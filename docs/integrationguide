# Introduction

As long as there have been applications managing organizational data
into a database, there has been a need to share that data between
different departments and therefore, usually, different systems. In a
typical design/manufacturing organization there could be at least four
or five mission critical databases that manage the data for different
departments and for different stages in the product’s lifecycle.

Initially these systems provide the capabilities required by their
consumers, i.e., the departments that use these systems. For instance,
finance will use a finance system such as Quick books. Manufacturing
might use a manufacturing planning and execution system (MES).
Engineering, a Product Data management System (PDM) and so on for each
group in the organization.

What this leads to is disparate silos of data and therefore knowledge.
The departments in an organization do not work in a vacuum – each is
dependent on information that is generated by other groups. For
instance, Manufacturing can’t produce correct assembly instructions
without input from engineering in the way of the designs and the bill of
materials. Finance can’t cost the product without understanding its
contents or understanding which parts are manufactured in-house or
purchased.

Therefore, the need to integrate these systems becomes critical for the
organization to function optimally. Initially, connecting one system to
another can be a straightforward process. Obviously is usually involves
some services to get the systems to talk to each other, however it
shouldn’t be too painful as long as the requirements are clearly
defined.

Anyone who has implemented integrations between PLM systems (Product
Lifecycle Management) or ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) will tell
you of the nightmare scenarios that they encountered. Often this is the
result of poorly scoped and defined requirements, conflicting
requirements coming from multiple departments and the many integration
points required between systems. The result is that the organization is
not getting what it wanted or needs, the customer is paying for services
that do not provide the promised solution and usually the project is
long overdue. All this equals an unhappy customer and often the software
vendor’s solutions are blamed for the disaster.

Over the years many technologies have appeared and some of them, just as
quickly disappeared to help with enabling integration without the need
to write thousands of lines of custom code that needs to be re-written
every time there’s a software upgrade. Lately there have been several
new technologies that provide “codeless” integration between SaaS
products – an example of this is Zapier (zapier.com). These solutions
are particularly good for generic use cases for data exchange between
systems but can be limited when it comes to custom modifications to the
data being sent that might be required by a specific customer. In
addition, they have the overhead of requiring a subscription to their
service. An additional concern that I have heard is regarding sending
corporate IP through another third party and data security.

Therefore, we can understand that in most organizations integration
between systems is a necessary evil that must be tackled – either with
an Out-Of-The-Box solution or through some custom coding.

Early on, Onshape understood that as an engineering system, it cannot
exist in a vacuum – it must be able to communicate with other systems.
For this reason, the REST API was developed.

An<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" /> API, or *application
programming interface*, is a set of rules that define how applications
or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is
an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST,
or *representational state transfer *architectural style. For this
reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs*.*

#  About this book

## Who is this book for?

Whether you are a developer wanting to integrate Onshape to other
systems or you are just trying to educate yourself on how a modern
application such as Onshape integrates with other systems, this guide is
designed for you.

While some programing experience will help a lot, it is not required.
For the first two sections of this guide, we focus on the technology and
how Onshape differs from other similar systems.

The third section of the guide focuses on specific business cases for
integration and describes in detail the methodologies around each
business case. These business cases are generic in nature and very
common for any integration. Most of the code samples are very
self-explanatory and are commented to provide additional explanations
where required.

## How this book is organized

This guide is divided into three main sections:

We start by introducing Onshape and how it differs from traditional CAD
and PDM/PLM systems. Onshape is a solution that was built from scratch
for the cloud – a true multi-tenant SaaS solution. This means that the
architecture, the technologies used and many of the practices in Onshape
differ from traditional yet older systems. It is very important to
understand these differences when implementing an integration. In this
first section we highlight many of the important differences between
Onshape and traditional systems and how an integration might look using
these new concepts. We also discuss integration best practices for
Onshape.

In the second section of the guide, we look at how to connect an
application to Onshape and authenticate that application against Onshape
using OAuth2. We provide an in-depth look at what OAuth2 and how to use
it to connect a third-party application to Onshape. We also discuss how
an application can be embedded inside the Onshape interface and how a
third-party application can make functionality available inside the
Onshape menu interface. This section of the book is critical to
understanding how to setup a third-party application, and enable it to
access Onshape’s resources securely.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.40278in;height:0.40278in" />Finally, in the third section
of the guide we examine in detail, three common business cases for
integration between Onshape and third-party systems. This section delves
into some code examples and best practices for using the APIs. We also
take a look at how to setup Application Extensions in Onshape and enable
Onshape to access a third-party application’s resources. This section
also contains a detailed explanation and samples for using Onshape’s
webhooks.

The code samples in this book use Node.js. Other programing languages
such as Python, C#, Java or PHP can be used based upon your use case and
own personal preference.

# Onshape – a new architecture

Onshape was built from the ground up as a true SaaS based system. The
importance of this is that Onshape had no investment in legacy code and
was able to develop an application that truly runs as a multi-tenant
SaaS solution from the first line of code. Many companies claim to run
cloud-based solutions, however, since they have such a large investment
in their legacy code that they can’t just discard and start again from
scratch, they tend to try and port that code to the web.

More often than not, porting existing code to the web and calling it a
SaaS solution is no more than a marketing ploy – it isn’t a true SaaS
solution if it wasn’t written as one. These are generally known as cloud
hosted solutions. This means that a typical three tier data management
solution that could have previously been installed on a set or servers,
has now been modified to be hosted on the web.

### Traditional Three-Tier Architecture

Traditional PLM systems typically use a three-tier architecture – mainly
consisting of an application server, a database server, and a client
which can be a web client or a thick client installed on the client
hardware.

<img src="images/media/image10.png"
style="width:4.91807in;height:3.27083in"
alt="The 3-tier architecture | Download Scientific Diagram" />

<span id="_Toc102977872" class="anchor"></span>Figure 1 - Typical
three-tier architecture

To connect to this and integrate with it, generally APIs were exposed on
the application/Web server. Here we can already see that if this
architecture is ported to the web, it would not be possible to make
customizations through API since you would be modifying the behavior of
the program for everyone connected to this application server.

### Single vs Multiple Tenant Architectures

The architecture shown on the previous page is very typical of most
Product Lifecycle management solutions on the market today. It is fine
when you want the solution installed on company servers and only
accessible to people within the company.

When such a solution is ported to the web, more often than not, software
vendors will be required to create a Single tenant application where an
application server and a database server are provisioned for each new
customer.

<img src="images/media/image11.png"
style="width:5.4311in;height:4.35417in"
alt="Enterprise SaaS Architecture - The Why | Frontegg" />

<span id="_Toc102977873" class="anchor"></span>Figure 2 - Single Tenant
Architecture

In the case above, the vendor will be required to throw more expensive
hardware at the solution in order to host more customers – this is not a
sustainable model long term.

Modern 21<sup>st</sup> century software solutions use multi-tenant
solutions that can be hosted on services such as Amazon cloud, Azure and
more. There are many benefits to this architecture however the immediate
clear benefits can be seen as servers can be provisioned and
decommissioned on the fly to provide ultimate performance whenever
required. Since servers cost money, decommissioning servers when they
are not required is a key benefit to a true SaaS solution.

<img src="images/media/image12.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.65417in"
alt="Saas Solutions - Multi-tenant vs multi-instance architectures" />

<span id="_Toc102977874" class="anchor"></span>Figure 3 - Multi-Tenant
Architecture

Since each application is separate in this architecture, we can
therefore enable customizations that can’t be implemented in a single
tenant architecture where multiple customers are connected to one single
application server. An example of this is providing access to the REST
APIs that are required for integration. In the single-tenant
architecture, if you provide API access to the application server, one
customer will be modifying that application for all customers who are
registered on that tenant.

### What is a REST API?

As mentioned previously, Onshape uses REST APIs to communicate with
third party systems. In short you call a REST API as you would a web
page. It has a specific web address and often some additional parameters
that are required either in the URL itself or form data that can be
attached to the web call. The web call instead of returning a web page
will return information. The response from the API call is formatted in
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

REST APIs use HTTP standards such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE

**GET**: Retrieve information from the server. Any arguments are
included in the URL sent to the server

**POST**: Update the server with new information. Data required is
included in the body of the request – the same as how a web form submits
data to a server.

**PUT**: Update an existing record

**DELETE**: Delete information from the server

In addition, Header information will be sent with the request – this
will include authentication credentials that verify if your application
is in fact authorized to run this API.

alt="PHP RESTful Web Service API – Part 1 – Introduction with Step-by-step Example - Phppot" />

<span id="_Toc102977875" class="anchor"></span>Figure 4 - REST API
Architecture

An example of an Onshape REST API call would be the following. This GET
API is used to retrieve information about a specific document in
Onshape:

https://cad.onshpae.com/api/documents/72de34014b590a923c87

The response from this API is too long to show here however it will be
in JSON format and contain information regarding the document’s
workspace, the owner of the document, permissions and a lot of other
relevant information.

Onshape’s APIs reference REST API Tips and Tricks section.

### What is JSON?

JSON (**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation)

The following explanation of the JSON format is taken directly from
json.org:

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines
to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript
Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON
is a text format that is completely language independent but uses
conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of
languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and
many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange
language.

JSON is built on two structures:

-   A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is
    realized as an *object*, record, struct, dictionary, hash table,
    keyed list, or associative array.

-   An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as
    an *array*, vector, list, or sequence.

These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming
languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a
data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be
based on these structures.

The following is the basic format of JSON:

Object: {

“attribute”: “value”,

“attribute”: “value”

}

A simple example of a JSON object could be the following:

“Person”:{

“firstname”: “Joe”,

“lastname: “Smith”,

“Age”: 31

}

This is an object that describes a person named Joe Smith who is 31
years old.

To this object we can add an array of children as follows:

{

"Person": {

“firstname”: “Joe”,

“lastname": “Smith”,

“Age”: 31,

"children": \[

> {"name": "Bill”, "age": 5},

{"name": "Sarah", "age": 2}

\]

}

}

As we can see here, we added an array of 2 children to our “Person”
object by using the square brackets \[\] – which denotes an array.

There’s not much more to the JSON format that we need to know other than
this basic structure of objects with key pair values.

Programing languages such as JavaScript will natively understand this
format and translate it to a list of objects that can be referenced in
your code in the following format – Person.children\[0\].name in this
case the result will equal “Bill”. Alternatively, you can iterate
through the results retrieving the relevant information from each
object.

<img src="images/media/image8.png"
style="width:0.44444in;height:0.44444in" /> The JSON returned from
Onshape can often contain a lot of information and be very long. In
order to understand this data a lot easier it can be useful to use a
JSON parser tool that enables you to browse the data in a tree view that
can be expanded.

One of the one’s I use is <http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/>. This
application allows you to paste your JSON data directly into a text
editor and then view it in a viewer tab where you can easily view the
structure and find specific attributes and values.

## The Onshape difference

If your familiar with how other CAD systems function, or you’ve worked
on integrations to other CAD systems, then please read this section.
Onshape does not work like other legacy CAD systems. As mentioned
previously, Onshape was built from scratch for the cloud and as a modern
CAD system. It stands to reason that many of the failings of legacy CAD
systems were not included in Onshape. Onshape does work differently to
any other CAD and as a result, you can’t apply the same integration
methodology to a legacy CAD system to Onshape.

### The Key Onshape differentiators

In this section I’m going to focus on several of the key differences in
Onshape as it pertains to integrations. There are many more differences
and benefits to Onshape, however these are well documented in the Help
and training materials delivered through Onshape.

The information in this section is important as far as integrations are
concerned given that Onshape does not behave as traditional file-based
systems do. With this in mind, when writing an integration, it is
critical to understand the nuances in Onshape’s design practices and how
data is organized in Onshape.

#### Data Driven – No files

Most traditional PDM/PLM systems that are integrated with CAD systems
enable this integration on a per-file basis. This means that you have an
object in the PDM/PLM system that corresponds directly to a file in the
CAD system. In this way the PDM/PLM system can manage access to the
files, build assemblies from the files, view the CAD data and much more.
Onshape does not work this way – it is a data driven system.

Being data-driven means that Onshape has no files – just data. This will
already tell you that an integration into Onshape is going to look
different from any integration to a CAD system that you might have done
previously.

In traditional CAD a single file represents a snapshot of what the
design looked like at a specific moment in time – for all intense and
purposes, unless it’s changed it will remain in that state forever. PDM
systems manage these files and once the designer decides to make a
revision or a release, the file is locked and a new file can be created
to represent any further updated versions or releases of the design.
PDM/PLM systems are very good at managing this data in an up-to-date
structure, however it does have the drawbacks of generating many file
copies of a specific design and once a file is taken out from the system
– for instance; to share with a supplier, it is no longer managed and
tracked.

Onshape uses data in place of files. The data is always up-to-date and
can be collaborated on in real-time without the need to send file copies
around. This means that Onshape views versions and releases differently
than those traditional systems do, therefore we should be re-thinking
how the integration will work with data in place of multiple files.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Files can be generated from
the Onshape data. An example of this could be generating a PDF of a
drawing upon release, or of a STEP file that can be used by other
systems downstream from engineering. The generation of such files can be
automated and is addressed in this guide.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />A key benefit of a data
driven system is the ability to retrieve real-time very detailed
analytics. Onshape has very comprehensive analytics; for instance, an
authorized person can view who edited a design, when and exactly what
they did to that design, i.e. which commands they used and how long they
spend on the modifying the design.

#### PDM is built-in

Up until now, CAD was one software program and PDM/PLM was another
program that had to be integrated with the CAD. In many cases both
programs could be sold by the same software vendor, even though there
are many PLM systems available that are sold by independent vendors who
have no CAD system. Regardless a PDM/PLM system always had to be a
“bolt-on” solution to the CAD system.

No matter how deep the integration between a CAD system and a PLM
system, there is always the need to sync data between the two systems,
this can always be a week point in any solution and prone to errors.

Being data driven, Onshape already has PDM built in as part of the CAD
system. This is unique in the industry – CAD and PDM as part and parcel
of the same solution with no bolt-on piece of software required. There
are many benefits to this approach beyond the fact that there is no
syncing between various systems in order to achieve the data management
aspects of the CAD system.

<img src="images/media/image14.png"
style="width:4.49202in;height:4.1652in"
alt="A picture containing graphical user interface Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977876" class="anchor"></span>Figure 5 - Onshape’s
revision and part number schema definition interface

For instance:

-   Since the data is always up to date, the correct state of any design
    is always represented in real-time with no delay for syncing between
    systems.

-   The data is never locked as is the case in file-based systems – it
    is always available and always changing.

-   The data management aspects of CAD that were generally associated
    with the PDM system are now fully integrated into every aspect of
    the CAD system.

-   True real-time collaboration/co-design on both design and data is
    enabled

So, what does this mean when it comes to integrating Onshape with
another PLM system? First and foremost, we must understand that there
are many things that a PLM system does that Onshape’s PDM capabilities
can’t do. Integrating Onshape to a PLM system should augment the
powerful capabilities already available inside Onshape and not
necessarily replace them. Likewise, Onshape does not come to replace PLM
native capabilities. Instead, depending on the business case we should
be using the best-in-class capabilities of each system to augment the
other.

An example of augmenting capabilities of each system could be the
release process.

Onshape has a specific way of managing the release of data that is
different from traditional PDM systems. This capability is inherently
suited to a data driven approach and provides a lot of value to the
update of design data in Onshape. At the same time, PLM systems provide
enterprise release processes that may include many people and different
departments that extend beyond the engineering domain. Such PLM
processes can be highly customized and suited to the organizations
established business processes.

In this scenario it makes no sense to not use the enterprise release
processes in the PLM system, however also not using Onshape’s release
capabilities could put data between Onshape and the PLM system out of
sync and prevent Onshape from updating data – such as watermarks and
title blocks on drawings, icons related the visualizing the state of
data and more.

In this case we want to use the best-in-class features of each software
solution without compromising on capability provided by each solution.
If we plan our integration correctly this can be achieved by initiating
the release of the data in Onshape, transferring the release data to the
PLM system where the release process will be triggered and finally
automating the release in Onshape once the process has been completed in
the PLM system.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />This specific integrated
release scenario is detailed in this guide in the following sections. It
is a common requirement of larger enterprises that are making extensive
use of PLM systems and a scenario that is supported by Onshape’s REST
APIs.

#### Multi-Part Part Studios

In traditional CAD systems there is the understanding that one file =
one part. While design in context is available in most CAD systems and
multiple solid bodies can be created, it does not change the fact that
each part is self-contained in a separate file. For PLM systems this
makes it easy to associate an object in the PDM/PLM database with a
specific CAD file.

This is not the case in Onshape.

In Onshape, parts are designed in what’s called a “Part Studio”. Within
a Part Studio the designer is free to create as many parts as they want.
The general rule is that the parts should be related to each other in a
system thereby making it easier to design one part from another, however
there is a lot of flexibility in how the designer wishes to work.

<img src="images/media/image15.png"
style="width:4.45764in;height:4.12141in"
alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977877" class="anchor"></span>Figure 6 - An example of
a multi-part Part Studio in Onshape

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />The structure of the Onshape
document is discussed in detail further on in this section. The Part
Studio is included in an Onshape document

We can already begin to understand that the traditional CAD/PDM paradigm
of one file per object is not going to work with Onshape. If this
methodology were to be implemented, the designer would be forced by the
PDM/PLM system to only create one part per Part Studio. This would
therefore limit the designer’s freedom for creativity in Onshape and
seriously reduce the powerful functionality available for the designer
to use.

Therefore, we need to re-think how we integrate with Onshape vs how we
integrate with traditional CAD systems. Fortunately, Onshape’s REST API
supports the multi-part Part Studio scenario. Instead of associating a
file with an object in the PDM/PLM database, we now use the REST API to
associate a Part with its corresponding object.

#### Versions and Releases

Traditional PDM/PLM systems provide design release support by locking a
CAD file for access. The access controls are defined in the database and
the definition of a Part/Assembly/Drawing as released is controlled by
the database. When a new revision of the part is required, a file copy
is made, and the database provides access to the new copy. Generally,
the old copy representing the previous release persists in the file
store and can be referenced by the database.

This is not how Onshape works.

<img src="images/media/image16.png"
style="width:2.66865in;height:3.09375in" />Since there are no files in
Onshape – just data – there is no file locking and copy mechanisms
available. Instead Onshape looks at the data as a continuous timeline
that is always moving forward and always changing as the design evolves.
The data is never locked, it is always available.

In place of file copies representing versions and releases of the
design, Onshape provides the ability to create versions as “bookmarks”
in the timeline. When creating a version, Onshape places a bookmark in
the timeline that represents the state of the design at that specific
moment in time. Releases work in a similar way, however they are defined
as official company approved processes and have special meaning whereas
versions are personal bookmarks that save the state of the design at a
specific moment in time. Still, as far as Onshape is concerned, they are
points in the timeline that represent a release or a version.

In addition to creating versions and releases Onshape has the capability
to create branches. These could be defined as alternative timelines. A
designer might want to experiment with alternate design ideas without
modifying the existing design that other people might be working on. By
creating a branch from any point in the timeline, the designer is now
free to experiment with alternate ideas. If the ideas work, they can be
merged into the current timeline at any point.

Obviously from an integration perspective we need to take into
consideration how Onshape works with versions and releases. As
mentioned, Onshape understands that a release represents a company
approved design and it therefore provides processes for the approval of
a release and the change of state of a design. Onshape also provides
APIs and triggers (events) that enable integration points throughout the
release process. It is through the triggers and the APIs that
integration of any third-party system that wishes to manage the release
process is enabled.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />This scenario and the
methodologies around the integration of release processes is discussed
in depth in the last section of this book.

#### Workflows

Release and obsoletion workflows are included with Onshape – these
processes can be customized to meet company standards. While this
section of the book doesn’t go into any depth on the topic of
customizing workflows, it is important to understand how Onshape’s
workflows work and provide integration points.

For details on how to implement and customize Onshape’s workflows,
please review these online help topics:

-   How to Design release management Processes can be referenced
    [here](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/relmgmt_custom.htm?tocpath=Enterprise%7CGetting%20Started%20as%20an%20Enterprise%20Administrator%7C_____8)

-   Creating a Customized Release Workflow can be referenced
    [here](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/custom_workflow.htm?tocpath=Enterprise%7CGetting%20Started%20as%20an%20Enterprise%20Administrator%7C_____7)

Most PDM and PLM systems have the capabilities to model a company’s
business processes in a workflow. These can be highly automated
processes that move data and file references through a process of
reviews and approvals. Onshape also has this capability which is
currently used for release and obsoletion processes.

However, in Onshape there are no files or file references that are moved
through the process. Onshape only has data. Therefore, it is the data
that is referenced at each stage of the process. Traditional PDM systems
might make file copies and lock files as they move through a release
process – for instance. If the process is rejected at any stage, those
files must be discarded, the previous version of the files unlocked and
all states updated – in short, rewind back to the state of the files and
the data when the workflow was initiated. This is a lot of complex
actions that need to occur when a process is rejected for any reason.

Onshape doesn’t work this way.

A release process can be started on data – such as assemblies, parts,
drawings, etc. The state of those referenced parts are updated to
“Pending” for instance. If the process is rejected at any stage, there
is no rewinding of files and data – the data just reverts to the
original “In Progress” state and the workflow is discarded. Since the
workflow didn’t complete – nothing related to the data has actually
changed. When you are used to traditional PDM systems, this feels like
an anti-climax and we often receive the question, “But where’s my
process? Where’s the data that was attached to the process?”. Well, the
answer is – nothing changed – until the process is completed, nothing
actually changes so the data is in the same state it was prior to the
initialization of the release process.

style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />We will be using a custom
workflow during the Business Case 2: Sync Revisions and releases
scenario that is detailed later in this book.

### The Document Structure

When integrating with Onshape it’s very important to understand how an
Onshape document is defined. There are quite a few components to a
document that are inputs into most REST API calls. This section
describes the various parts of a document and how they are referenced.

There are four key parts to a document as follows:

1.  A Document

2.  An element

3.  A Workspace

4.  A version

<img src="images/media/image18.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.18681in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

<img src="images/media/image19.png"
style="width:1.96875in;height:1.92945in" />The document is the container
that includes all the content related to a specific design. It could be
described as the project that contains all the relevant information
related to a design. This would include multiple versions, Assemblies,
Drawings and any other related documentation that has been attached to
the design.

An element is a tab included in a document. You can add as many elements
to a document as you wish. An element can be a Part Studio, an Assembly,
A drawing, a file, or a custom application. Folders are not considered
elements – they are containers that include elements and are used to
group elements together in logical groupings.

Onshape can contain multiple workspaces however you always start off
with the “Main” workspace. Additional workspaces are created by
branching from the main timeline. As mentioned previously, branches are
used to make modifications and experiments on a design without having to
change the main design that multiple people might be involved in. A
workspace can be merged back to the main workspace at any time.

A version is any version or release created in the timeline. You can go
back to a specific version by clicking on it and viewing the state of
the design at that point in time. Versions can be referenced in the
APIs.

#### The Onshape URL

Since Onshape is a web based solution it uses a URL to define what gets
loaded in the browser. Depending what we are looking at in the browser,
the URL might change, however while we are working on a design we will
most often see a URL that looks something like the following:

https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1a1e1448eb196be9cb49d5b3/w/d6824c9ad8a44f4ae370bc56/e/4a823863687f4e7e1bbc858d

The first part of the URL defines the Onshape enterprise that we are
working under – in this case it’s the default cad.onshape.com

The second part: **/documents/** provides the unique ID of the document
that we have loaded in the browser.

The third part **/w/** provides the unique ID of the workspace that we
are currently working in.

The final part of the URL **/e/** is the current element (or tab) that
is open.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />All these values are often
referenced in the API calls as either input to a POST request or
returned from a GET request.

An additional value that is relevant is the version ID **/v/** that will
be displayed in the URL when you click on a specific version in the
timeline.

https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1a1e1448eb196be9cb49d5b3/v/5d8dba3ffc41601291b5d7bf/e/4a823863687f4e7e1bbc858d

These are the most important parts of a document related to
integrations. We will be presenting additional concepts related to
customizing a document in the next section of this guide.

## Integration Considerations

As we have seen, there is much to Onshape that is different from
traditional CAD and PDM systems. For system integrators who have
previous experience with these types of systems the instinct is to try
and apply the concepts developed for those integrations to an Onshape
integration – this is a mistake. Applying existing integration concepts
to Onshape simply won’t work.

There are several key points related to integrations that I want to make
here. Most of these points are generic concepts that should be applied
to any integration and are mostly common sense.

1.  **Do not limit the capabilities of the software**: When applying
    integration practices of legacy file-based solutions to Onshape you
    will be required to adjust the way designers work in Onshape to
    accommodate the limitations of your integration. Instead, the
    integration should utilize best practices and methodologies that can
    be applied to modern SaaS based solutions.

2.  **Enable designers the freedom to work without constraints**:
    Designers working in a CAD system should never have their ability to
    use the software features to the fullest restricted by the demands
    of badly architected integration. The software is designed to
    provide its users with the freedom to innovate and the flexibility
    to adjust to how a designer wants to work. When an integrator places
    usage constraints on the users of the software it is always to
    intended to cover gaps in the solution and cut corners.

3.  **Utilize the best in class features from each solution**: Different
    software solutions are designed to provide features that should
    provide expected functionality for whatever function the software
    was designed to do. For instance, a CAD system should have best in
    class tools for modeling, whereas data management tools should
    provide capabilities to manage, analyze and report on data. While
    there might be overlap between systems, it is a best practice to let
    each software solution do exactly what it was designed to do instead
    of forcing one to perform the functions of the other.

4.  **Map out your business processes**: Decide which software solution
    is responsible for which part of the process. It will be impossible
    to develop a successful integration if the requirements aren’t
    clearly stated. The business process(es) that you are managing
    through the integration should be mapped out as should the systems
    involved, and which system is responsible for which function.

5.  **Use standards** **and Published APIs**: The worst thing that can
    happen is when thousands of lines of code and days of work are
    thrown away because of an upgrade of a piece of software. By using
    industry standards and published APIs you will protect yourself from
    such a disaster.

# Integrating 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Applications with Onshape

Onshape uses industry standards for establishing a secure connection
between itself and a third-party application. In order to access
Onshape’s resources, any application requesting those resources must be
authenticated by Onshape. Likewise, if Onshape needs to access resources
from a third-party application, Onshape must be correctly authenticated
by the third party prior to access being granted.

In order to enable this Onshape uses OAuth 2.0

## Authentication Overview

### What is OAuth2?

The OAuth (Open authorization) protocol was developed by the Internet
Engineering Task Force - The Internet Engineering Task Force is an open
standards organization, which develops and promotes voluntary Internet
standards, in particular the technical standards that comprise the
Internet protocol suite – it enables secure delegated access to an
applications resources.

The OAuth2 protocol enables an application to access a resource that is
under the control of someone else. In order to access that resource a
Token is required. The Token represent the delegated rights of access
(defines what rights this application has such as read/write/update,
scope, rights to different resources and more). In this way the
application can be accessed by a third party system without that system
impersonating the user who controls the resource.

A good analogy is the hotel check-in process.

When you arrive at the front desk of a hotel you are generally asked to
provide an ID and a form of payment. In response you are provided with a
key card that opens a specific door. When you reach that door, you swipe
your key card and you are granted access. The door itself doesn’t know
who you are or anything about you – it just knows that the key card was
encoded correctly, and it allows you access. At some point in time the
key card expires and the door no longer lets you into the room. This is
the same for Access Tokens in the OAuth2 flow.

###  How Does OAuth Work?

With the OAuth2 protocol, you register your application with the
3<sup>rd</sup> party, you are given a set of keys. These keys get
exchanged for an Access Token that grants you access to resources in the
3<sup>rd</sup> party application. Every now and then that token expires
and in order to access the resources, you are required to get a new
token. For this, you are provided with a refresh token. Sending the
refresh token to the authentication server will provide you with your
updated access token and a new refresh token. In our analogy the
Authorization server is the same as the clerk at the check-in desk, he’s
validating that we’re registered and that we can in fact access the
resources in the hotel. Once validated he provides us with a key card =
authorization token. With this card we can now access our room, the gym
and possibly some other hotel resources. Likewise, the authorization
token enables us to access the API resources.

<img src="images/media/image20.png"
style="width:5.2782in;height:3.375in"
alt="Getting Started with OAuth2 - Keap Developer Portal" />

<span id="_Toc102977881" class="anchor"></span>Figure 10 - OAuth2
Authorization Flow

The first step to the OAuth flow is for the Onshape user to request
Onshape to authorize access for the 3<sup>rd</sup> party application to
access Onshape.

Once the user has authorized the application, they will be redirected to
a predefined URL together with a code that will be used to request an
access token from Onshape. Therefore, the redirect URL should contain a
script that can capture the authorization code.

The access token is the token you will use to authenticate requests to
the Onshape API. Note that the token expires after predefined set amount
of time. In order to get a new valid access token after one has expired,
you must use the refresh token to request a new access token.

Refreshing the Access Token will also provide you with an updated
refresh token that will be used in the next refresh access token
request. Make sure to store both the access token and the refresh token
and update them with each refresh of the token.

The authorization token must accompany any call to the API, this is done
by adding the token to an Authorization field in the header of each
request:

‘Authorization’ : ‘Bearer \[authorization code here\]’

If correctly authenticated the response from the REST API call will be a
stream of JSON data with an HTTP response code of 200.

In the event that the authorization code is incorrect – for instance, if
it expired, you will receive an **HTTP 401** response. This response
means that the client request has not been completed since it lacks
valid authentication credentials for the requested resource. In this
event your code for each call to the REST API should include a catch
clause for a 401 exception. Once caught, you can refresh the token and
make the request again.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />

We provide a complete code example for catching errors from the HTTP
request at the end of this section.

information on implementing OAuth2 with Onshape at
<https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/oauth/>

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />A very good resource for
learning more about OAuth2 can be found at
<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2>

## Enabling a 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Application in Onshape

Now that we have understood the basics of the OAuth2 flow, we should be
well equipped to understand how to setup a 3<sup>rd</sup> party
application that can communicate with Onshape’s APIs and receive
notifications from Onshape via events.

To get started you will be required to request a login for:

<https://dev-portal.onshape.com/> if you require a login, please email
<api-support@onshape.com>.

This developer portal has links to documentation and some public
examples on the Onshape GitHub which can be found here:
<https://github.com/onshape-public>.

Let’s get started by clicking on the OAuth applications menu option on
the left side of the screen. Then click on the “Create new OAuth
application” button on the top right.

<img src="images/media/image21.png"
style="width:4.22532in;height:4.4569in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977882" class="anchor"></span>Figure 11: Create new
OAuth Application interface

The fields in this screen should be filled out as follows:

1.  **Name** – this is the application name that you wish to display to
    the users. It should include the name of your company to
    differentiate it from other possibly similar application. I.e.
    “JambaCorp PLM” instead of just “PLM”.

2.  **Primary format** - this string uniquely identifies your
    application and is a marker for the data it might store on Onshape
    servers. It should take the form of a Java style reverse domain
    name: com.jambacorp.plm. This value cannot be changed after the
    application is registered.

3.  **Summary** – this is a description of your application. This is
    displayed to the user when they’re asked to grant the application
    permission to access their data.

4.  **Redirect URLs** - Your application must specify at least one URL
    used in the OAuth protocol exchanges. This URL must also use SSL (a
    URL that begins with https), with two exceptions applicable for
    installed desktop applications. Possible reasons for specifying more
    than one redirect URI is if you deploy “test” and “production”
    versions of your application, and want to use a specific version of
    your application for different sets of users.

5.  **Admin Team** – this is an optional field. If defined, members of
    the admin team selected will have access to make changes to the
    definition of this OAuth application.

6.  **OAuth URL** – This URL is the “Authentication Page” for your
    application. This is the first URL called from the Onshape
    Applications page (described in detail in the next section). The
    page hosted at this URL should handle the OAuth authentication. Once
    your application’s server has been authenticated on behalf of the
    user, that user should be redirected to your applications content.

7.  **Permissions** – this is also called application scope and it
    defines what access rights you want your application to have with
    regards to the user’s data. The options are as follows:

    1.  **Application can read your profile information** – this will
        enable your application to access the Onshape user profile.

    2.  **Application can read your documents** – Onshape documents
        created by this user can be accessed with read privileges only

    3.  **Application can write to your documents** – The user owned
        Onshape documents can be modified by this application

    4.  **Application can delete documents and workspaces** – Your
        application will be able to delete a workspace within a document
        or the complete Onshape document.

    5.  **Application can request Purchases on Your behalf** – The
        application will have access to make purchases if required.

    6.  Application can Share and unshare documents on your behalf –
        Onshape’s document sharing capabilities are very powerful and
        enable other parties to access your shared documents with
        predefined rights. If this option is checked, the application
        will be able to automatically share a document with other
        people.

Once you fill in all this information and click on the “Create
Application” button, Onshape will return to you an OAuth Client ID and
an OAuth Client Secret string – these keys will be used in your code for
requesting a one-time user authorization code from Onshape. They will
identify to Onshape the registered application. While the Client ID is
considered public - it is how your specific application is uniquely
identified in OAuth protocol exchanges - the Client Secret must be
stored securely. For example, it should NOT be checked in to source code
control systems. Protect the Client Secret as you would any password
data.

Your application is now registered with Onshape and you have options to
modify the application definition through this portal.

style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Later in this chapter we will
take a deep dive into defining Application Extensions in Onshape and
passing OAuth2 credentials to a third-party application in order that
Onshape may access the resources of that app.

## Implementing OAuth2 in your Code

In this section we take a look at some sample code of how the OAuth2
authorization flow is enabled. We’re not showing the complete code here,
just the relevant parts of the code that relate to authentication
against Onshape and using the REST API with the acquired access token.
There are plenty of online resources that show this flow in more detail,
however here we are focused on the implementation of OAuth2 in regards
to Onshape.

The code samples are provided in node.JS, however you are free to use
any programing language of your choice in developing your integration.
There are good resources on the Onshape public GitHub in both node.JS,
Python, Java and C# - these can be found at:
<https://github.com/onshape-public>.

So far, we have registered our application with Onshape and received an
OAuth Client ID and an OAuth Client Secret string. We will be using
these strings in this section in order to receive a one-time user
authorization code.

### Step 1: get the user authorization code

We’ll start by loading the basic libraries required to run this sample.
Since this is node.JS I’m using npm to directly load the libraries into
my development environment.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />The samples here just relate
to the authentication portions of the code and assume that you have
knowledge on setting up and running a Node.js server. All the settings
in this sample are stored in an .env file and referenced through config
class. Where required I have made comments which expected value each
setting is referencing

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Passport is Express
compatible authentication middleware for Node.js. Its sole purpose is to
authenticate requests which it does through plugins known as strategies.
In this sample we are using an Onshape developed plugin
“passport-onshape”, however this is not mandatory, and you can define
your own strategy to use with passport. The passport API is very
straightforward; you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and
passport will provide hooks for controlling what occurs when
authentication succeeds or fails. For more information on Passport
please reference <https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport>

To install Passport

$ npm install passport

To install passport-onshape plugin for Passport

$ npm install passport-onshape

Define your app.js (Server file).

const express = require('express');

const session = require('express-session');

const passport = require('passport');

const OnshapeStrategy = require('passport-onshape');

Tell Express to use Passport and initialize passport

var app = express();

app.use(session({

secret: session_secret,

resave: false,

saveUninitialized: true

}));

app.use(passport.initialize());

app.use(passport.session());

Store Onshape user information so it can be retrieved from req.user in
each call.

passport.serializeUser((user, done) =\> done(null, user));

passport.deserializeUser((obj, done) =\> done(null, obj));

Notes on serializeUser and deserializeUser:

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Passport uses the
serializeUser function to persist user data (after successful
authentication) into the session. The function deserializeUser is used
to retrieve user data from session.

Passport needs the following setup to save user data after
authentication in the session:

app.use(session({ secret: session_secret }));

app.use(passport.initialize());

app.use(passport.session());

The following diagram explains what happens with the serialize and
deserialize functions.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />To learn more about Passport
please reference <https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport>

Initialize Passport with the Onshape Strategy

passport.use(new OnshapeStrategy({

clientID: oauth_clientid, //the client ID string that you got when
registering the app with Onshape

clientSecret: oauth_clent_secret, //The secret string

callbackURL: oauth_callback, //The Oauth Callback URL ex: /oauthRedirect

authorizationURL: oauthurl, //https://oauth.onshape.com/oauth/authorize

tokenURL: oauthtokenurl, //https://oauth.onshape.com/oauth/token

userProfileURL: userprofileurl
//https://cad.onshape.com/api/users/sessioninfo

},

(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) =\> {

profile.accessToken = accessToken;

profile.refreshToken = refreshToken;

//Here you can store the user profile, accessToken, RrefreshToken in
your database

userController.updateUser(accessToken, refreshToken, user
).then((data)=\>{});

return done(null, data);

}

));

The OnshapeStrategy takes six values, all which should be stored in your
.env (or configuration) file. There are several values that don’t change
and should use the following definitions:

1.  authorizationURL : <https://oauth.onshape.com/oauth/authorize>

2.  tokenURL : <https://oauth.onshape.com/oauth/token>

3.  userProfileURL : <https://cad.onshape.com/api/users/sessioninfo>

The callback function will provide us with the accessToken, the
refreshToken and the user’s Onshape profile once authentication has been
successfully passed. We can now use this to update our database with
user specific information.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Note that if you store the
accessToken and refreshToken in the database along with the user record,
this will have to be updated each time that the access codes are
refreshed.

Next we define our endpoint where the authorization flow starts in this
case ‘/oauthSignin’. This is the endpoint that we previously defined in
the Onshape application setup. This will redirect to an Onshape page in
order for the user to confirm (or deny) the applications access to the
Onshape resources.

app.use('/oauthSignin', (req, res) =\> {

return passport.authenticate('onshape', { state: uuid.v4() })(req, res);

}, (req, res) =\> { /\* redirected to Onshape for authentication \*/ });

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.46528in" />The state fields can be used
to store relevant information such as documentId, ElementId,
WorkspaceId, etc – in the event that this information is sent from
Onshape. In this sample we have not defined any fields.

The following page is displayed:

<img src="images/media/image23.png"
style="width:4.74911in;height:3.28125in"
alt="Graphical user interface, application, Teams Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977885" class="anchor"></span>Figure 14 - Onshape
Authorize Application Interface

This page pulls information, such as the name, the description, the
permissions from the original application setup in Onshape. Once the
user clicks on the “Authorize application” button, the flow will
redirect to the redirectURL defined in the application setup.

### step2: Exchange the code for an access token

Fortunately, if you are using Passport, there really isn’t a lot that
you need to do once the user clicks the “Authorize Application” button.
The return URL will contain the one-time authorization token and the
passport will extract that and exchange it for an access Token and a
refresh token. These will be available in the Passport callback function
shown previously.

//OAuth2 redirect code will be replaced for a token

app.use('/oauthRedirect', passport.authenticate('onshape', {
failureRedirect: '/grantDenied' }), (req, res) =\> {

// additional optional redirect parameters to be added to the redirect
URL

res.redirect(\`/?authsuccess=true\`);

});

In the above code there are a few interesting points.

Firstly, if the user clicked on the “Deny” button, the user is navigated
to a page that notifies that access to the application was denied. We
can see that in the “failureRedirect” argument. The route for calling
the “grantDenied.html“ page is defined below:

app.get('/grantDenied', (req, res) =\> {

res.sendFile(path.join(\_\_dirname, 'public', 'html',
'grantDenied.html'));

})

Another interesting point to mention is the following line:

res.redirect(\`/?authsuccess=true\`);

Here, we can add additional parameters to the URL that gets called once
the OAuth process completes successfully. In this case I’m adding a
simple argument that lets my index page know that authorization
completed successfully. The index page then produces a notification that
the application has been successfully authenticated by Onshape.

<img src="images/media/image24.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.88611in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, website Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977886" class="anchor"></span>Figure 15 - Notifying the
user of successful authentication

### step 3: Using the access token

Our application is now registered and successfully authenticated by
Onshape. This means that the application can access Onshape’s resources
as long as a valid access token is provided along with our API calls.

The ‘access_token’ must be supplied on all subsequent Onshape API
requests as a header value: Authorization: Bearer \<access_token\> The
access token uniquely identifies the combination of your application,
the Onshape user and the set of permissions granted for the access
token.

The access token has a limited lifetime of 60 minutes, after which it
will no longer work and attempts to use it will result in an error
response for an Onshape API request. The application must use the
refresh token returned by the original authorization code exchange to
generate new access tokens

The following code is a complete example of getting metadata for a
specific Part. The documentId, WorkspaceId, ElementID and PartId have
been sent over as arguments. The user data including the access token
and the refresh token is included in the request object.

![](images/media/image25.emf)

For making the web call I am using a library called “axios” there are
many such libraries available on npm, however do check that they are
still supported. I initiated the axios library in this way after
installing it:

const axios = require('axios').default;

More details regarding the axios library can be found here:
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios>

In the code above note the catch clause:

}).catch(function (data) {

if (data.statusCode === 401) {

authentication.refreshOAuthToken(req, res).then(function () {

getMetadata(docid, wsid, eleid, pid, req, res);

})

If the call to the Onshape API fails for any reason it is caught by this
catch clause. The first reason for failure would probably be because the
accessToken has expired, this would return an HTTP 401 error – not
authorized.

If this is the case, we are sending a request to refresh the access
token. Once that request comes back with a new token, we are calling our
getMetadata function again.

The refresh Token functionality is explained in detail in the next
section.

In the code above, all the metadata properties are returned in JSON
format in the response.data.properties object.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note that in the call
authentication.refreshOAuthToken “authentication” is a library of
methods related to authenticating the user and the application through
OAuth2. For simplicity of explanation, I have until now, placed all my
calls in the app.js file, however it is a better practice to organize
all the OAuth2 calls in the same library.

### Step 4: Refreshing the token

We have already seen a call to refresh the access token in the previous
section. As mentioned previously I have all my OAuth2 refresh code in my
authentication library.

When the access token expires it must be refreshed by making another
POST request to https://oauth.onshape.com/oauth/token with the following
URL encoded form body (again, with
Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded):

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=\<refresh_token\>&client_id=\<client_id\>&client_secret=\<client_secret\>.

As with the authorization code data, the parameters in the form body
must be URL encoded. The response to this POST request will be a JSON
encoded structure as before with a new access_token value that can be
used for the next 60 minutes.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Refresh tokens are valid for
the lifetime of the user’s grant. If a user who has previously granted
access to your application decides to revoke the grant, the refresh
token is invalidated. If the user decides to re-grant application
access, a new refresh token is generated and returned along with the
access token.

The following code takes care of the call to Onshape’s authorization
server to refresh the access token.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note that in this sample it
is using the npm package “request” to make the web call. This package
has since been depreciated and you should use another supported package,
such as axios.

![](images/media/image26.emf)

We use the variable pendingTokenRefreshes to hold the value of the
session.id. If pendingTokenRefreshes is populated with the session.id,
that would mean that there is a token refresh already pending. This
would occur if there were multiple calls to the Onshape API while the
refresh was still pending.

![](images/media/image27.emf)

The final part of the relevant code is the onOAthTokenReceived. This is
called following a successful call to refresh the token. The access
token and the refresh token are updated in the req.user object and if
you wish you can update the database with the refreshed information.

![](images/media/image28.emf)

###  User Grant of Authorization

As mentioned previously, it is the Onshape user who actually grants
authorization to the third-party application to access the Onshape data.
This must be done by each user who needs to work with the third-part
application.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />In order to grant access,
after logging into Onshape, the user should click on the top right menu
that drops down from their name.

Note that this menu will look different depending upon the users
specific rights and enterprises that he/she has access to.

<img src="images/media/image29.png"
style="width:1.89869in;height:2.26471in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

Click in the “My Account” option. This will bring up the user’s profile.
The click on the “Applications” option on the left side menu.

<img src="images/media/image30.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.20764in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

This is where the user grants access to an application. Find the
third-party application that you wish to authorize and click on the
“Grant” button in the “Onshape access” column.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note that where you see a
“Grant” button in the “external access” column, this means that the
application requires Onshape to access its resources. We will examine a
business case in the next section where this is a requirement.

Once you click on the “Grant” button, you should see a page similar to
the following “Authorize Application” screen shown below.

<img src="images/media/image23.png"
style="width:5.13542in;height:3.54816in"
alt="Graphical user interface, application, Teams Description automatically generated" />

Click to authorize the application and you will now be redirected to
that application and access to the Onshape resources and your user
profile in Onshape would have been granted successfully.

###  OAuth2 Summary

Implementing OAuth2 can be complex since it’s a multi-step process that
requires specific data to be delivered at specific times in a specific
format. Using a library such as Passport does make our lives a lot
easier when implementing such a solution.

We’ve covered a lot of ground in this section. First, defining a
third-part application in Onshape, understanding what OAuth2 is and how
it works through concreate examples of how to implement it and
communicate with Onshape.

In the end, simplifying the explanation, OAuth2 is a three-step process
that secures your applications and guarantees that an application isn’t
impersonating a user when it access the resources, but is a validated
“known” entity that the user approves to access the data.

The code shown here is sample code intended to provide you with the
logic of how this process works. If you’ve implemented OAuth previously
this should be very self explanatory, and if not, feel free to use these
code samples and adjust them to your own needs.

It is important to mention that if you wish Onshape to access data from
your application, the same sort of mechanism must be implemented in your
code. Onshape supports through its app extensions the ability to connect
through OAuth2 to a third-party app and retrieve data from that
application. This implementation I shown in the next section where we
get into specific business cases for integration.

# The methodology of specific Business Cases

## Methodology Introduction

This section of the guide focuses on the implementation of specific
common business cases that are found in most integrations. In the
previous section we have spent a lot of time attempting to clarify how
third-party apps are setup and communicate securely with Onshape through
the OAuth2 flow. In this section we will continue that topic and expand
upon it by looking at how we can setup a third-party app that Onshape
will pull data from.

As part of the business cases documented here we will also look in depth
at the methodologies around setting up and using web hooks (events) in
Onshape.

One of the most common business cases, which is the first we will look
at, will use both webhooks as well as expand upon the OAuth2 subject by
enabling Onshape to pull data from our third-party application. In this
business case, we will pull part numbers from the third-party
application. Those part numbers are calculated based upon input pushed
from Onshape to the third-party application.

Another common business case deals with the release of data. Whether the
data is released initially in Onshape or in the third-party application,
we need to keep those releases in sync. The examples that we will use
here build off each other yet can also be provided as standalone
solutions. In our second business case we use data pushed to the
third-part application in the first scenario to release data and push
notifications back to Onshape.

The third and final business case deals with the creation of derivative
files, such as PDF, STEP, etc. once the release has been successfully
completed.

## Business Case 1: Sync Objects and Metadata

### Business case 1 Overview

The first business case is probably the most common, “How do I sync data
that I create in Onshape with my ERP or PLM system?”. There could be
many reasons why you would want to sync data between two different
systems. Primarily Onshape is a system that creates new data. This data
is created by designers as they perform their daily tasks. While the
designer works primarily in Onshape, the actual data that they create
does not exist in a vacuum, it is used by other departments, other
processes within the organization. These departments and processes
probably do not have access to Onshape or the required knowledge of how
to use Onshape. In addition, quite often, the data generated by Onshape
will be augmented with additional data as the product lifecycle process
progresses.

Therefore, Onshape could be considered the genesis of the data that will
be used to develop a product, yet it is not the only data that will be
required.

In this business case we examine how a designer could work in Onshape
and how the data generated by Onshape can be used to make decisions in
other systems. Based upon the decisions made, data is pushed back to
Onshape as values calculated in another system. Let’s look at the
process in much more detail.

#### Step 1 Define Properties in Onshape: 

<img src="images/media/image31.png"
style="width:5.41667in;height:1.84722in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

1.  In the first step, the designer starts a new part in Onshape –
    remember that in Onshape a Part can be created along with other
    parts in a Part Studio, so we can assume that there could be
    multiple parts created in the single document. Obviously, we want
    the designer to have the freedom to use all Onshape functionality
    without constraints placed by the demands of the integration.

2.  At some point in the design process, the designer will be required
    to enter property values for the part – these could include values
    such as the Part Name, the description, material and so on.

3.  The designer clicks the “Save” or “Apply” button for the properties
    and closes the properties window.

4.  A web hook that listens to any changes in the properties has been
    defined. As the user saves the properties, the web hook is
    triggered, and it will send a notification through the defined web
    hook to the third-party system.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note: There are Part
properties, workspace properties and document properties – all these
properties live at different levels of the document. While the trigger
could pick up changes to any to these properties, we are currently
focused on just Part properties – the event will be triggered on any
saving of properties, however our third-party code can ignore anything
that’s not a Part (or an Assembly). In this next step we assume that a
new object is being created in the third-party application.

#### Step 2 Create Corresponding Object:

<img src="images/media/image32.png"
style="width:5.16667in;height:2.13889in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

1.  Once the designer made changes to the properties in Onshape and
    saved those changes, a message is sent to our third-party
    application. This message is in JSON format and contains minimal
    information such as the Workspace ID, the Document ID, the Element
    ID, the Part ID (if it’s a Part) and information regarding the event
    that was triggered. The third-party application receives this
    information to an endpoint that was defined during the setup of the
    web hook.

2.  The code in our application can now use the ID’s sent over to check
    if an object with corresponding IDs exists in our system. Here we
    are assuming that no such object exists. This does mean that we must
    store Onshape IDs into our objects in the third-party system.

3.  We then create a new object and populate the ID information and save
    it to the database. Note that at this point in time, we only have
    minimal information that provides no more than the identity of the
    Onshape Part.

4.  Next, in order to get the complete metadata, we must make a REST API
    call to Onshape in order to get the metadata for the part. Since we
    were provided the ID information in the web hook, we have enough
    information to go back to Onshape and request the metadata for a
    specific, document, element, workspace and part.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note that you can either
store the Onshape IDs in separate fields in your database or as one long
unique string which can be used to easily identify the part in your
application.

#### Step 3 Get Onshape Metadata:

<img src="images/media/image33.png"
style="width:5.75in;height:2.04167in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message Description automatically generated" />

1.  The response from the call to the Onshape API is sent back as JSON.
    The data will contain a lot of different objects that represent the
    property values, their types, the IDs, name of the property, value
    of the property, etc.

2.  Once received this data must be parsed by your third-party
    application code and the corresponding object updated as required.
    For bi-directional update, it is important to store the Onshape
    property IDs of any data that will need to be synced back to Onshape
    from the third-party application.

3.  This is an optional stage. Once you have all the metadata values
    imported, you could now calculate any values that are based off the
    metadata. The most common use case scenario is the generation of
    intelligent part numbers. Based off configuration, part type, etc.,
    you could generate a part number that has specific meaning within
    the context of the company.

4.  If you calculated specific values, you can now store them in your
    database.

#### Step 4 Modify Properties in Onshape:

<img src="images/media/image34.png"
style="width:5.04167in;height:3.97222in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

1.  As in Step 1 the designer updates the properties in Onshape – this
    is obviously something that can happen multiple times

2.  The web hook is triggered when the designer saves the property
    changes

3.  Our third-party application is listening for property changes

4.  The third-party application’s code will check if the corresponding
    object exists based off the IDs sent from Onshape.

5.  In this scenario the corresponding object has already been saved in
    our system

6.  We make a REST API call to Onshape to get the metadata based off the
    IDs sent from Onshape.

7.  Onshape returns the JSON that represents the updated properties

8.  We ingest the updated metadata and update our existing object in the
    third-party system.

#### Step 5: Request Part Number

<img src="images/media/image35.png"
style="width:5.76389in;height:2.13889in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message Description automatically generated" />

1.  As we will see later, Onshape has the built in capability to pull
    custom part numbers from a third-party system. From either the
    properties window or the release candidate window, click the button
    to request a part number

2.  Onshape sends basic ID information to a predefined endpoint in our
    third-party app.

3.  The ID information sent by Onshape is enough data to find the
    corresponding object in our database. We then extract from that
    object the pre-calculated intelligent part number – or we can
    calculate it at this point.

4.  The part number is returned to Onshape and populated in the Part
    Number field

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note that in order to pull a
part number from a third-party application we will need to implement
OAuth2 in our application and grant Onshape access to the resources of
our application. Onshape has a very good mechanism for achieving this
and we will be explaining this in detail in this section.

Note that by default Onshape uses its own internal Part number
generator, in order to use a custom third-party generator, we will need
to define an app extension and then define in the Enterprise release
settings to use our custom part number generator.

#### Step 6: Push Updates from Third-Party application

<img src="images/media/image36.png"
style="width:5.75in;height:2.45833in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message Description automatically generated" />

1.  In this scenario we are updating an Object in our third-party
    application and expecting that some of the property values will be
    updated in Onshape. We can either send over all the properties
    populated for this object, or a subset of properties and values

2.  The REST API to update properties in Onshape requires that we
    reference the IDs of the properties that we are updating. For this
    reason we have stored the Onshape property IDs with our metadata
    object in our database.

3.  We construct the correct JSON that contains all the properties to
    update and the new values. We can then call the Onshape REST API to
    update the properties in Onshape with the new data.

4.  Once successfully completed, the Onshape REST API call will return
    HTTP 200 and we can notify the user if needed.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note that updates to Onshape
will happen behind the scenes in real-time, therefore someone working on
the document in Onshape will be able to see the updates as soon as they
have been made. There is no notification in Onshape that notifies the
user that properties have been updated, however you can open the
properties window and view the updated data.

### Business case 1 implementation

In this section of the guide, we’ll really dig into the implementation
of the first business case that we outlined previously. The concepts and
procedures that we introduce here will be relevant for the rest of the
business cases and provide a foundation for any other integration
development with Onshape.

We’ll start by defining an App Extension in Onshape so that we can
receive custom part numbers.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />It is important to mention
that this guide does not go into complete detail with regards to App
extensions, it just focuses on the requirements for this specific
business case. For the complete App Extension guide please reference
this link: <https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/extensions/>

#### REST API Tips and Tricks

<img src="images/media/image8.png"
style="width:0.44444in;height:0.44444in" /> There are many endpoints
available in the Onshape REST API. While in this guide we have
documented a few of the APIs that are relevant to the business cases we
are discussing, there are many, many more APIs available. While there
isn’t complete documentation available for all the endpoints, there are
some useful tools that we can use to better understand the APIs and what
input they require and output they provide.

##### Glassworks

Glassworks is Onshape’s official API explorer. It lists all the
available endpoints, provides the ability to run the APIs within its
interface and provides the output from the API. Actual documentation of
each API is scant at the moment; however we can expect this to improve
over time.

Glassworks can be found at: <https://cad.onshape.com/glassworks>

Glassworks provides several ways to connect to Onshape so that you can
try out the APIs

1.  OAuth2 – input your OAUth2 credentials

2.  API Key – input your API key as defined in the Onshape developer
    portal.

3.  Onshape Cookie – If you are running Onshape in a browser tab,
    Glassworks can use that logged in session to authenticate the API
    calls.

<img src="images/media/image8.png"
style="width:0.44444in;height:0.44444in" />If you choose to use the
Onshape Cookie note that the domain names should match. Therefore of you
are using cad.onshpae.com, the domain for Glassworks should be:
<https://cad.onshape.com/glassworks> however, if you are using your own
enterprise such as myenterprise.onshape.com, then the correct URL for
Glassworks will be <https://myenterprise.onshape.com/glassworks>

All of these options can be set by clicking on the Authorize button
found close to the top of the page.

<img src="images/media/image37.png"

alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977893" class="anchor"></span>Figure 22 - Glassworks
Authentication Options

The complete list of available endpoints is categorized by topic; i.e.
Document related endpoints appear in the Documents category, Metadata
related endpoints in the Metadata category – so it should be relatively
easy to find the endpoint you are looking for.

<img src="images/media/image38.png"
style="width:5.51469in;height:4.04234in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977894" class="anchor"></span>Figure 23 Glassworks "Try
It Out" feature

The above image shows the “Try It Out” feature of Glassworks, in this
case we can see the JSON returned for a specified document.

In some cases, the input requirements are not fully documented.
Specifically when a body is required for an API call. While we expect
Glassworks to improve with full documentation overtime, it still lacs
some key documentation.

Fortunately there is another easy way to view the requirements of an API
and that is to actually run the command in Onshape.

##### Debug Using Browser Developer Tools

All Browsers now have developer tools exposed in their interface. These
tools provide us ways to debug client code, view console messages and
most importantly for our use case, view Network requests and their
response.

In this example I am using Chrome’s developer tools. Most other Browsers
have more or less copied Chrome’s layout for the developer tools so it
should be easy to find the network section.

<img src="images/media/image39.png"
style="width:5.36972in;height:4.16096in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977895" class="anchor"></span>Figure 24 Accessing
Chrome's Developer Tools

Let’s take the simple use case of trying to understand which endpoint
Onshape uses for saving Metadata.

Open a document in Onshape and define some properties – don’t save yet.

<img src="images/media/image40.png"
style="width:3.42406in;height:2.25966in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

Prior to saving open the developer tools and click on the “Network” tab.

<img src="images/media/image41.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.37014in"
alt="Table Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977896" class="anchor"></span>Figure 25 Developer Tools
Network Tab

Next save the updated properties by clicking either the Apply Button or
the Save Button

In the Network tab you will see a new web request – select it:

<img src="images/media/image42.png"
style="width:5.40656in;height:2.82458in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977897" class="anchor"></span>Figure 26 Network Request
Sample

What we are seeing here is the response from the call to Save the
properties. We can expand this response to view the complete JSON.

By clicking on the Headers we can view the actual request:

<img src="images/media/image43.png"
style="width:5.125in;height:2.47222in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977898" class="anchor"></span>Figure 27 HTTP POST
Request for Saving Properties

Here we can see that this will correspond to the APIs listed in
Glassworks.

Most importantly the “Payload” tab is our definition of the body of the
request. This is provided in JSON format and can be expanded. As shown
here:

<img src="images/media/image44.png"
style="width:4.90769in;height:2.94205in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977899" class="anchor"></span>Figure 28 HTTP POST Body

We now have the correct API call and the format of the body to
successfully make the API call. We can also see from the body that if we
wish to update properties in Onshape from our third-party application,
we need to store the propertyID value.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />It is important to mention –
ALWAYS use cad.onshape.com to make API calls (no matter what you see in
the Headers tab or is shown in the Payload tab.

#### Define an Application Extension

An application extension is how Onshape embeds third-party application
features in its UI. There are two types of extension:

1.  An extension that embeds its UI from the application into the
    Onshape UI in an iFrame. Such a application my call Onshape REST
    APIs or just expose an application interface inside Onshape.

2.  An extension that embeds and that calls a REST API exposed by the
    application from the Onshape UI. For instance, embedding application
    functionality in the context menus or toolbars. This type of
    application extension relies on external OAuth information in order
    to authenticate the call. In this case Onshape acts as the client
    and the application as the server.

Each extension will exist at a specific location in the Onshape UI and
will work within the context of that location or a specific selection,
passing the relative information to the application.

In order to define the Application Extension we return to the
development portal at <https://dev-portal.onshape.com/oauthApps> where
we initially defined our OAuth Application.

Select the OAuth Application that you previously defined and click on
the Extensions tab.

<img src="images/media/image45.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.37917in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, Teams Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977900" class="anchor"></span>Figure 29 - Oauth
Applications - Extensions

Start by clicking the “Add Extensions button.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note that you can create as
many extensions as you need for your application within the Onshape UI.

This is the interface where you define where in the Onshape UI the
command will appear, and what endpoint in your application the command
will reference. Changing the Location dropdown will provide additional
fields that can be defined to specify context and other relevant fields.

For our use case, Define a name, i.e. “Custom Part Number Generator”,
define a description of the extension and select “Part Number Generator”
from the Location dropdown. The only other field that you need to define
is the Action URL. This is the endpoint in your application where you
will fetch the part number from.

<img src="images/media/image46.png" style="width:4.125in;height:4.125in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977901" class="anchor"></span>Figure 30 - Define
Application Extension

Once you save the definition you will see it in the list of extensions.
You can always come back and edit the definition of the extension.

#### Grant Onshape Access to 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Data

If you require Onshape to access the resources of your application, then
you will need to define the external OAuth parameters. In our use case
we will need Onshape to access data in our application in order to pull
the part numbers into Onshape.

Click on the External OAuth tab, the final tab on the OAuth Applications
page.

<img src="images/media/image47.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.27361in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977902" class="anchor"></span>Figure 31 - Define
External OAuth

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />In this guide we’re not
detailing the implementation of OAuth2 inside your application, this is
explained very well in many on-line guides. My favorite of these can be
found at:
<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2>

Onshape provides the fields that are required for it to make a secure
request to your application, receive an access Token and refresh it when
required. In this case Onshape acts as the client and your application
as the server – this is the inverse to what we defined when we enabled
the third-party application to access Onshape.

Once you have defined the fields, Save/Update the definitions. We have
now completed defining the application extension and enabling Onshape to
access your applications resources.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Note if you haven’t defined
all the endpoints at this time, you can come back later and update the
information once you have it defined in your application.

The last thing we need to do is for the user to grant access for Onshape
to access your applications resources. We can do this through the same
interface that we used to grant access to Onshape.

From inside Onshape go to your account settings, from the top right
dropdown menu. Click on the applications page.

For applications that have an application extension and External OAuth
defined we have the “Grant” button available in the “external Access”
column as shown here:

<img src="images/media/image48.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.87083in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977903" class="anchor"></span>Figure 32 - Grant
External Access

Click the “Grant” Button in the External Access column.

Your third-party application will present the user with option to
authorize access to the application – similar to this simple interface:

<img src="images/media/image49.png"
style="width:4.25285in;height:1.71051in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977904" class="anchor"></span>Figure 33 - Enabling
Onshape to access a 3rd parties data

If you click “Allow”, you will be returned to Onshapes Applications page
and external access will be granted.

#### Defining Webhooks

Now that we’ve defined our application extension and OAuth access to our
application, we can start on receiving notifications in our application
when events happen in Onshape.

Onshape supports webhook notification for many different types of
events. We will register an endpoint in our application that will
receive a notification whenever something occurs in Onshape. In our
specific scenario this will be when the user updates the Onshape
properties – as we defined in **Step 1 Define Properties in Onshape**:

For our purposes we will be registering to receive web hook
notifications for the onshape.model.lifecycle.metadata event. When
registering for an event in Onshape there are only two pieces of
information required:

1.  The event (onshape.model.lifecycle.metadata)

2.  The Enterprise ID

To easily find your enterprise ID, in Onshape select the Enterprise
Settings option from the top right dropdown menu and then click on the
“Details” menu option on the left-hand menu bar.

You will see your Enterprise ID and a “Copy to Clipboard” button next to
it. This will enable you to directly copy this unique ID into your code.

<img src="images/media/image50.png"
style="width:3.0006in;height:2.70759in"
alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977905" class="anchor"></span>Figure 34 - Finding Your
Enterprise ID

The following code shows how we can register a webhook in Onshape.

![](images/media/image51.emf)In this example I’ve hard-coded a few of
the values for clarity, however this method could be re-written to be a
generic model for registering various webhooks. Some good examples of
registering for webhooks exist at <https://github.com/onshape-public>.

As with other calls to Onshape that we’ve seen, we are passing the
accessToken in the header in order to establish a secure call to
Onshape’s resources.

The information coming back from the registration call will be similar
to the following:

{

"timestamp": "2014-12-16T23:45:10.611-0500",

"event": "webhook.register",

"workspaceId": "000000000000000000000000",

"elementId": "000000000000000000000000",

"webhookId": "544e91f7fb88ed44f5de1508",

"messageId": "34795d2e5f5f44eeb61fb7b1",

"data": "Some data",

"documentId": "000000000000000000000000",

"versionId": "000000000000000000000000"

}

In our example we are saving the event
(onshape.model.lifecycle.metadata) and the returned webhookId to a
database in order that we can later ping it to make sure that it is
live.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Following the registration of
the webhook, Onshape will attempt to make a call to the Notify URL
defined in the body of the registration request. This is the endpoint of
your application that should be called when the event is fired in
Onshape. The most common reason for registration failures is that the
endpoint you defined, does not return an HTTP 200 status code.
Therefore, even if you registered for an event and received a
registration notification and a webhookId back from Onshape, your web
hook is not in fact registered until Onshape validates the notify URL
and receives the HTTP 200 notification back from it. Unfortunately there
is no way to easily know if your web hook has been successfully
registered until you either ping it, request to list it, or try to
activate the event through Onshape.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Also it is important to know
that even when your webhook is registered successfully, if you change
your code later on and Onshape fails to receive an HTTP 200 status code
back from the notify URL, the web hook will be removed.

One of the ways we can validate that a webhook is “live” is by pinging
it using the Onshape REST API. The following code shows the
implementation of a ping to the webhook. If an HTTP status code of 200
is returned, we know that the webhook is enabled, if not then we can
re-register the webhook as needed.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />![](images/media/image52.emf)Once
we store the webhook ID in the database we can ping the webhook whenever
the application is loaded and validate that it’s still registered. If we
need to re-register the webhook (usually only occurs when changes are
made to the code in the notify URL), we can create a new webhook
registration and update the database record.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Note that you can create many
duplicate webhook registrations for the same event with the exact same
notify URL. Onshape doesn’t limit how many registrations are created for
a single webhook. In the event that this happens, the notify URL will be
called as many times as there are webhooks registered for that event.
You can validate the registered webhooks by calling the
**<https://cad.onshape.com/api/webhooks>** API.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Use
<https://cad.onshape.com/glassworks> to call APIs and validate the
requirements for each REST API call. This interface lists all the
available Onshape REST APIs and provides examples of the values returned
from each call.

#### Receiving Webhook notifications

Once your webhook is registered and confirmed to be working you should
be getting a notification from the webhook to your notify URL. The
notification should be similar to the following:

{

"timestamp": "2014-12-16T23:46:29.284-0500",

"event": "onshape.document.lifecycle.metadata",

"workspaceId": "000000000000000000000000",

"elementId": "000000000000000000000000",

"webhookId": "544e91f7fb88ed44f5de1508",

"messageId": "60f54ac1cbc04179a6642d9a",

"data": "Some data",

"documentId": "0f9c4392e5934f30b48ab645",

"versionId": "000000000000000000000000",

"documentState": "IN PROGRESS"

}

In your case the workspaceId, elementID, documentID, and PartId should
be populated with the values from the Onshape document that was open
when the properties were updated.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />It is important to note that
there is currently no OAuth validation on the webhook response,
therefore the endpoint in your application will not receive any access
token data for directly calling Onshape APIs. Therefore, if you need to
make a call to the Onshape REST APIs inside the notify URL endpoint make
a call to an endpoint in your application and include your application
OAuth credentials in the body of the request. In this way, you can make
a call to your application and load the passport and the Onshape
credentials.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Onshape takes security very
seriously and for this reason, unauthenticated calls only provide
minimal details such aa, in this case, id’s.

#### Getting Onshape Properties

In our specific use case, when we received the webhook notification, we
want to use the ID data provided to find the corresponding object in our
database (or create a new one) as shown in Step 2 Create Corresponding
Object: Then we make a call to the Onshape REST API:
/metadata/d/{did}/{wvm}/{wvmid}/e/{eid}/{iden}/{pid}

All the relevant data is provided in the response from the webhook so we
can pass this to the method which will call this API as follows:

![](images/media/image53.emf)From this call I am returning the
“properties” part of the JSON – this contains all the metadata
definitions that I wish to store in my database and associate with the
corresponding object. The following is an example of one of the property
objects:

![](images/media/image54.emf)

In fact there is probably only three key pairs that we’re interested in
here:

1.  Name – name of the property. In this case “Name”

2.  Value – the value of the property. In this case “Top Plate”

3.  propertyId – the ID of this property. We might need this if we want
    to enable a bi-directional sync between both applications.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Note that for valueType
CATEGORY the actual name, value and id will be embedded deeper in the
object inside an array. I suggest copying and pasting the output from
the API call into a JSON viewer such as http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/ so
that it will be easier to find where the correct values are.

We can now update our corresponding object with the Onshape metadata
values as described in Step 3 Get Onshape Metadata:

#### Updating Onshape

So far we have pulled data from Onshape and populated it into our
third-party application, however what if we make updates in our
application that we want to propagate back to Onshape? This is certainly
possible through Onshape’s REST API. Usually this would be implemented
in your application on the click of a button – such as “Save”, if you
have multiple properties to update, or when a property is updated if you
want to trigger the sync for the update of a specific field.

Either way it is fairly straight forward to send the REST API call to
Onshape to update properties. The following snippet of code shows how
the call can be made:

![](images/media/image55.emf)As we can see here, we provide the body in
the form of JSON that includes an array of items (in this case one item)
and a nested array of properties (two property objects are listed here).
Each property has a value and an ID of the property in Onshape to
update.

The response from this API call should be an HTTP 200 status. If this is
the case, we can update the user that the sync was successful.

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />If you know that you want to
update Onshape with property values from your application, it will be
important to build a data model that can store the properties with the
unique ID provided by Onshape.

#### Implementing Custom Part Numbers

<img src="images/media/image56.png"
style="width:2.95556in;height:2.94924in" />The final step in this
business case is to pull the part numbers form our third-party
application. The part numbers can be calculated based on metadata values
that were previously synced from Onshape or they might be numbers being
pulled from yet another system – such as an ERP or even a Google
Spreadsheet. The important thing is that when the user clicks a button
in Onshape, the correct Part Numbers get populated.

To first understand how the setup for pulling part numbers from a
third-party application we need to go back to the definition of our
Application Extension in the Onshape developer’s portal.

Here we can see that we gave the application extension a name, defined
the location as “Part Number Generator” and defined the “Action URL” –
this is the endpoint in our application where we will fetch the part
number from.

Once we have the application extension defined as Location = Part Number
Generator, you will be able to use this option inside Onshape Release
Management settings.

<img src="images/media/image4.png"
style="width:0.43056in;height:0.43056in" />Note that in order to use the
Part Number Generator option you will have to define the External OAuth
option and grant Onshape access to the resources of your application.
This is because Onshape will need to access the defined endpoint in
order to pull the part number from the application

From within Onshape Select the “Enterprise Settings” from the top right
dropdown menu. Navigate to the “Release Management” settings and scroll
down to the “Revisions and part numbers” section of the page.

<img src="images/media/image57.png"
style="width:4.05994in;height:3.27831in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977907" class="anchor"></span>Figure 36 - Revisions and
Part Number Settings

In the Part Number Generation dropdown select the “Custom Part Number
Generator”. Note that this is the name that you defined in your
Application Extension so it might differ from what’s shown here.

<img src="images/media/image58.png"
style="width:2.73732in;height:2.03131in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977908" class="anchor"></span>Figure 37 - Selecting
Custom Part Number Generator

<img src="images/media/image6.png"
style="width:0.47222in;height:0.47222in" />Finally scroll to the bottom
of the page and save the settings.

Note that you will need the Admin role in order to access the enterprise
settings.

#### Implementing Part Number Code

Onshape will send a message to the endpoint defined in your application
extension settings. The content of this message will be an array of the
following data.

![](images/media/image59.emf)There might be one or more object depending
upon where the user initiated the call for part numbers from. For
instance, if the call was initiated from the Part properties window,
there will only be one object, however if initiated from the release
candidate window, multiple parts/assemblies and drawings might be
requested in the single call. Therefore, your code should be able to
handle these two situations.

Onshape will expect a response back from your endpoint and it should be
formatted in the following manner:

![](images/media/image60.emf)Note that in fact only the id and
partNumber fields are actually required – the other fields are optional.

The following is an implementation of the getNextPartNumber endpoint
that was defined in the application extension “Action URL” field:

![](images/media/image61.emf)This in turn calls a function that pulls
the next part number from the corresponding object in the database (this
was defined in, Step 5: Request Part Number). In this function I’m
defining the object that will be sent to Onshape with the part number.
This will be called multiple times depending how many objects were sent
from Onshape.

![](images/media/image62.emf)In this case I’m sending back all the data
required by Onshape, however it would be enough to just populate the id
and the partNumber.

Once you load the Part Properties window or the Release candidate
window, you can now request the Next Part number. The part number will
be pulled from the third-party application and populated in the relevant
fields as shown below.

<img src="images/media/image63.png"
style="width:4.59649in;height:3.80143in"
alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977909" class="anchor"></span>Figure 38 - Release
Candidate Part Number generation

## Business Case 2: Sync Revisions and releases

Our next business case builds off the previous one as far as we have
corresponding objects in both systems that are in sync with each other
through the REST API integration and by using Webhooks.

In this case, we’ll be looking at the ability for Onshape to sync its
release data with an external system and for that system to send
information back to Onshape with regards to released data.

This specific business case will look at what happens when you wish for
a PLM system to control the release of data instead of Onshape having
that control – this is in fact a common use case.

### Business case 2 Overview

<img src="images/media/image64.png"
style="width:3.21077in;height:2.56522in" />We have mentioned before that
Onshape has the ability to release data – it is totally integrated to
Onshape since there is no division between CAD capabilities and PDM
capabilities in Onshape – they are all part of the same solution. See
Versions and Releases for more information on how Onshape manages
releases. There is importance in releasing data through Onshape. Onshape
uses visual cues to show which parts are released in an assembly for
instance and which parts might have a newer revision. Onshape can also
add/remove watermarks to drawings and update the title block depending
on release states. Also, the BOM table can pull a parts release data and
display it. All this is dependent upon a release process being completed
in Onshape.

Many organizations have implemented Product Lifecycle management systems
(PLM). One of the key benefits of a PLM system is that it manages more
than just engineering data originating from the engineering department,
it deals with all the data related to the product – from concept through
retirement. Therefore, it is a system that is used by many groups and
departments throughout the organization.

Often, in release processes or Engineering Change processes, additional
input and approvals are required from various departments downstream
from engineering. PLM systems are very good at routing the data for
approval to users from multiple departments and groups throughout the
organization. Onshape, on the other hand, is very focused on the
engineering department and the data generated there. While it certainly
has the capabilities to bring other groups into approval processes, it
is not considered a process centric enterprise-wide system with the
capabilities of a PLM system.

Many companies will have well established processes that have been
modeled in their PLM system, it is much easier for us to integrate into
those processes than reinvent the wheel in Onshape.

This section looks at how we might have the best of both worlds,
initiate release processes in Onshape and update our Onshape visual cues
as well as have the PLM system manage the actual approvals and release.

This section uses concepts such as OAuth and web hooks that we have
introduced in detail in previous sections, therefore feel free to
reference those sections for more information on these topics.

#### Step 1: Initiate Release

<img src="images/media/image65.png"
style="width:4.88889in;height:2.02778in"
alt="Application Description automatically generated" />

In this first step we are using Onshape’s out-of-the-box capabilities to
initiate a release candidate – just as we would if we were releasing
natively in Onshape.

1.  We start by initiating the release on all the data that is required.
    In this step you should use a custom workflow that simply has one
    approval node.

2.  Define the mandatory and any other release properties in the release
    candidate window. <img src="images/media/image66.png"
    style="width:4.70609in;height:3.12281in"
    alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977911" class="anchor"></span>Figure 40 - Initiating a
release candidate

3.  Since an approver is required, we must provide a fictious
    user/approver that has been defined in the system – this could be
    named “Release Approver” for instance. The process will be sent to
    this approver even though they are not a real person and will not be
    able to approve the release. Instead, our release process will be
    approved by an external source.

4.  Finally, when everything is defined, submit the release. The window
    will close. Since the release is pending approval, the parts
    involved in the release will enter the state of “Pending” as shown
    here: <img src="images/media/image67.png"
    style="width:4.40131in;height:2.9375in"
    alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977912" class="anchor"></span>Figure 41 - Pending
Release

They will remain in this state until the release has been completed.

<img src="images/media/image68.png"
style="width:2.71208in;height:1.52174in" />It is important to note that
unlike traditional PDM systems where the files are locked for change
until the release is completed or rejected, Onshape does not lock the
files. As mentioned previously, Onshape views the releases as a point in
time. As far as Onshape is concerned, time moves forward, parts can
change and at a specific point in time, the parts are in a state of
pending. It is important to mention that this does in fact prevent
another release from being initiated on the parts until the previous
release has been completed.

#### Step 2: Initiating Release Process in 3<sup>rd</sup> Party app

<img src="images/media/image69.png"
style="width:5.34722in;height:3.34722in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

Once the user initiates the release candidate and the parts transition
to the “pending” state we can register for a webhook that will notify
our third-party application that the parts have changed state.

1.  Once the parts enter the workflow, the onshape.workflow.transition
    webhook will be triggered.

2.  Our third-party application should be listening for this event along
    with other data, we are provided with the objectId of the release
    package – this is all the data associated with the parts that are to
    be released. The response also contains the objectType and the
    transitionName; for our use case we will only concern ourselves with
    requests that have an objectType of “Release” and a transitionName
    of “Submit”.

3.  Using the ObjectId we make an API call to onshape;
    /api/releasepackages/\<releasePackageId\>?detailed=true

4.  This API call will return to us a JSON response containing all
    assemblies and parts in the release package. The following
    information should be extracted from the release package:

    1.  For each line item (assembly or part) extract the documentId,
        the elementId, elementType, versionId and PartId

    2.  Iterate through the top level properties and record the
        propertyId for property with the name “comment” – this will be
        used to update the release comments later on.

5.  Now that we have the relevant IDs we can update the state of our
    corresponding objects in the third party system and record any
    additional data such as the release comment field.

6.  Finally, we can kick off our official release process in the
    third-party application. This could be an automated process or a
    manual one.

#### Step 3: Complete Release Process

The release process continues in the third-party application until
approvals have been received by all required actors. Meanwhile in
Onshape the parts are in the pending state. In this step we close the
loop once the release process is completed.

<img src="images/media/image70.png"
style="width:5.375in;height:3.34722in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

1.  The release process managed by the third-party application is
    completed and the data in that system is released.

2.  Once this happens, we make a call to the Onshape API;
    /api/releasepackages/\<releasePackageId\> the releasePackageId is
    the ID we were provided with at the start of this process – While
    there are different ways of implementing this, I tend to store the
    ID and any other data related to the release in a custom “release
    Object” in my database so I can retrieve and update the release as
    required. In addition to the passing the release package ID, in the
    body of the request we should pass the id of the release comment and
    a value for the comment. This will update the release in Onshape
    with any relevant data.

3.  Onshape releases the data that was included in the release candidate
    and that completes the workflow process.

4.  Onshape will return a status code that indicates success or failure

5.  Finally we can optionally update the corresponding object to
    indicate that it is in sync with the Onshape data.

In the event that the release process is rejected at anytime, we can
send the releasePackages API request to Onshape with a REJECT workflow
Action argument. This will cause Onshape to reject the workflow and the
state of the parts at the specific release point in time, will be set to
“Rejected”.

alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977914" class="anchor"></span>Figure 43 - release
candidate rejected

Since our timeline is moving forward this has no actual effect on the
parts other than to cancel the pending release and enable them to be
released at another future point in time.

### Business case 2 implementation

In this section we will take a closer look at how to implement the
release scenario in our code. The first thing we need to do is define
the correct web hook to listen for the initiation of the release – this
means that once the user clicks the submit button on the release
candidate dialog, this web hook will be triggered.

#### Setup Webhook

![](images/media/image72.emf)

This code is very similar to what we defined previously for the metadata
update, instead here we are defining a hook for the
onshape.workflow.transition hook. As with other code examples that
require authentication, we have included error handling in order to
refresh that access token in the event that it has expired.

The onshape.workflow.transition will in fact fire whenever a revision or
release package transitions through different workflow states. In his
specific case we are only interested in catching the event when the
workflow is initially submitted. This can be filtered by the information
sent to the return URL, in this case
https://myserver.com/api/getReleaseData

In this implementation we are storing he webhook ID in the database so
that we can ping it when the application is loaded to make sure that it
is still active. Other implementations delete the webhook after it is
used and then recreate it as required. There is no specific preference
for which methodology is better – that depend s upon the requirements of
your integration.

#### Receiving Web Hook Notifications

Once the user who is initiating the release clicks the Submit button on
the Release Candidate dialog, the webhook will be triggered and a
message will be sent to the third-party application listening for that
webhook.

<img src="images/media/image66.png"
style="width:4.70609in;height:3.12281in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated" />

In our example the URL that the webhook data from Onshape gets sent to
is:

<https://myserver.com/api/getReleaseData>

In our application we can define a router for that end point as follows:

router.route('/getReleaseData').post(mymodule.getReleaseData);

In this case “mymodule” is where I’ve defined all the functionality for
managing data coming from Onshape. Since the webhook data contains no
authentication information (just minimal data is sent from the webhoom
for security reasons), we can’t directly authenticate our application
against Onshape, therefore we need to pass the data received from the
webhook through a method that will then add the authentication data to
our request object. The getReleaseData method simply passes the webhook
information received by the application to another authenticated
endpoint as follows:

![](images/media/image73.emf)

Here is the endpoint defined for processReleasePackage:

router.route('/processReleasePackage').post(authController.isAuthenticated,
releaseController.processReleasePackage);

As we can see here, we have now added in the authentication middleware -
authController.isAuthenticated - and can make secure calls to Onsahpe’s
API.

#### Getting Release Package Data

The parameter that the web hook sent over to our application that we
need to make use of is the ID of the release package. We can now make a
call to Onshape to retrieve the complete release package with the ID.

We get the release package ID from the request object and make the REST
API call to get the package as follows:

![](images/media/image74.emf)

The complete release package should be returned in “response”. We can
now parse that data to retrieve the properties we need. The most
important properties will the IDs of the parts that we are going to
release – these should already be synced with our system – if not, we
can create them from the data in the release package.

#### Saving Release Package Data

The next step is to save the properties of the release package to a
corresponding object in our database. We need at least the ID of the
release package so we can later release it automatically from the
third-party application. In this case I’m storing other properties that
came from the release candidate such as release name and description.

![](images/media/image75.emf)

<img src="images/media/image76.png"
style="width:3.01875in;height:4.38889in" />Most of this code deals with
retrieving values from the release package and storing them as a new
release object in the database. Additional values are associated with
the part in the PLM system. In a typical production scenario this code
would interface with the PLMs workflow capabilities and possibly kick
off a release or change process in that system. For our basic example we
are storing values from Onshape with our items and setting a state on
the part so that users can see that the part is pending release and take
actions required.

At this point in time, Onshape does not care that the part is pending a
release. The part in Onshape will remain in a pending state until it is
released by the PLM system. As noted previously, we used a user setup in
the system to specifically initiate the release, therefore no other
users will receive notifications from Onshape with regards to release
actions on this part.

#### Completing the Release

Once the release or change workflow has completed in the PLM system and
all approvals have been received, the Part/Item will be in a released
state in the PLM system. However, we must now update Onshape with the
correct release status of the parts. It is important that Onshape data
is in sync with the corresponding data in the PLM system for reasons of
data integrity and the visual cues used within Onshape to identify a
part as released.

In a typical scenario Onshape will be automatically updated once the
workflow completes in the PLM system. In our use case we are simplifying
the process by clicking a button to release the item. This will update
the state of the part in our system and send a REST API call to Onshape
to release the data in the release package (be it one part, an assembly
with multiple parts, or drawings).

![](images/media/image77.emf)

This code snippet updates the database with the released status of a
part. Since we stored data from the release package in our database we
now retrieve the “Comment” property so that we can send an updated value
to Onshape with the release.

let attrid = rp.props.find(ob =\> ob.name == "Comment");

The important line of code here is the REST API call to Onshape:

**axios.post('https://cad.onshape.com/api/releasepackages/' + id +
'?wfaction=RELEASE'**

The id provided here is the ID of the release package that we stored
when the web hook was called at the beginning of the process. The
“wfaction” argument indicates that the workflow action in Onshape should
be to release the data associated with this release package.

In this example we are also updating the release comments in Onshape,
for this reason we required the property ID of the Comment field – which
we also previously stored in our release object in the database.

## Business Case 3: Generate Derivative Files

It’s clear by now that Onshape doesn’t use files to store its data,
instead it is a data driven solution that is always up to date. Files
are a snapshot in time that provide a view of the design at a specific
point in time - such as at a release or version. A new file is required
for each “snapshot” and managing these files can get quite cumbersome.
However, there are situations that require that files be generated from
the Onshape data.

In general, we want files to be generated at defined points of time and
within the context of a business process – such as a release process.
The derived file could be a format such as a PDF of the drawing that is
generated following the successful release of the data. Also, a common
requirement is to generate STEP files or JT files that can be used in 3D
Printing or viewers embedded in PLM solutions. Regardless of the use
case Onshape has very good export capabilities for many different file
formats.

This business case examines how to automatically generate files derived
from the Onshape data. The process described here can be plugged into
many different use cases. In this specific example we are plugging the
translation use case into the Release Business case just after the
release is completed in the third-party application and Onshape is
updated. Since we already have all the relevant ID information for the
parts to translate from the release package data, we can directly call
the translation APIs after receiving notification that the release was
successfully executed in Onshape.

This business case could also be added as an application extension
directly into a context menu in Onshape see
<https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/extensions/> for more information
on how to add extensions to menus.

For more information on the Translation APIs please see
<https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/translation/>

### Business case 3 Overview

<img src="images/media/image80.png"
style="width:5.5in;height:4.79167in" />

1.  Once we have received an HTTP 200 status from the call to Onshape to
    release the release Package, we can proceed with the translation.
    The reason why we may want to wait till the release has successfully
    completed could be for several reasons:

    1.  We are generating a PDF of the drawing and want the “In
        Progress” watermark removed, and the title block updated with
        release information

    2.  We are generating files for 3D printing or for sending to a
        vendor to manufacture and we only want to send released data

2.  We can now make an API call to Onshape. In both the following cases
    we must pass the document Id, the version Id and element Id – all
    values that were available in the release package. Other values are
    dependent upon your specific use case and can be referenced in
    <https://cad.onshape.com/glassworks/explorer/#/PartStudio/createPartStudioTranslation>

    1.  For Assembly translation we can POST to :/api
        /assemblies/d/{did}/{wv}/{wvid}/e/{eid}/translations.

    2.  For Parts we can POST to:
        /api/partstudios/d/{did}/{wv}/{wvid}/e/{eid}/translations

3.  Three variables of importance are returned from the API call to
    translate: requestState, id (of the translation) and
    resultExternalDataIds. We should store or keep this data in memory
    until the translation is completed. Depending upon the requestState
    there might be additional data available in the response.

4.  We can now periodically ping the translation web service with the id
    retrieved in the last step. Using the GET call to
    /api/translation/{id} we will receive one of three responses in the
    requestState:

    1.  DONE

    2.  ACTIVE

    3.  FAILED

5.  Depending on the response we can either continue to periodically
    ping the translation service if we received ACTIVE

6.  Notify the user of a failed translation attempt if we received a
    FAILED response

7.  Make a call to Onshape to GET the translated file if we received a
    DONE response. To retrieve the translated file make a GET request to
    /api/documents/d/{documentId}/externaldata/{externalDataId}

8.  The file can now be stored in your third-party system or stored to
    an external drive depending upon your specific use case.

### Business case 3 implementation

As use cases go, this is a very straightforward process. The only
complexity here is deciding how to receive the notification from Onshape
that the translation has completed. There are several ways of
implementing this including using a webhook to notify us when the
translation completes. In the examples here I will show both the webhook
methodology as well as pinging Onshape with a status request every
couple of seconds. The status request can be initiated from the client
through an AJAX call or, as in the example I use here, from the server.

<img src="images/media/image81.png"
style="width:3.3395in;height:3.66667in" /> In our example I have added a
button to the interface of my third-party system that enables me to
request a translated file. In this use case I have hard coded that the
resulting file should be a STEP file – in a production ready
implementation, we would expect that one or more formats are available
and possibly selected by the user. In addition, a production ready
implementation might have automated the translation for whenever a part
is released. Other considerations for automation might include
identifying what is being released. I.e. if it’s a part then translate
to STEP, if it’s a Drawing then translate to PDF, etc. These are all
very common use cases.

#### Initiating the Translation

![](images/media/image82.emf)The code snippet shown here is fairly
straightforward. First it gets the ID of the part that was sent from the
client, it then uses that ID to retrieve the part from the database. The
part stored in our database already has all the required values to
successfully communicate with Onshape, such as the document ID, the
workspace ID and the element ID – all these values are used in the
translation request.

In the body of the request we can see some of the required values that
define how the part is to be translated to STEP. In this case I have
only included the minimum required key pairs for this translation.

The REST API call to translate an Onshape element returns an object that
includes the translationId – this is the value that will be used to ping
Onshape and request the status of the translation.

#### Ping Onshape for Translation

In this code snippet I have simplified things by including a function
that waits for a second and then pings Onshape again, It will continue
pinging Onshape until it receives back a status that is not “ACTIVE”.
Once the status returned is anything except “ACTIVE” it returns the
resulting object back to the client.

The id used here is the translationId retrieved from the result object
when the translation was initiated.

![](images/media/image83.emf)

Once the requestState is changed, this will indicate that the
translation has completed either with a FAIL or a DONE status. Depending
on the result we can define our logic on the client appropriately.

The following shows the object returned to the client from the
translation REST API. Note that the requestState is now set to “DONE”,,
meaning that the translation has completed
successfully.<img src="images/media/image84.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.17986in"
alt="A picture containing timeline Description automatically generated" />

With this data we can now request the file directly from Onshape. The ID
that we need to use to retrieve the file is the “resultExternalDataIds”.
Note that this is an array of values – since it makes sense that we
might be translating more than one part.

#### Retrieve Translated File

With the resultExternalDataIds we can now retrieve the translated file
from Onshape. The following code snippet does exactly this.

![](images/media/image85.emf)

The Onshape REST API

https://cad.onshape.com/api/documents/d/' + did + '/externaldata/' + id

retrieves the translated file – in this case the ID is
resultExternalDataIds\[0\] value.

Once this is completed, we use the response to save the file directly to
our server where the application is hosted. Finally, I’m sending a JSON
object to the client that provides a direct link to the file that is now
hosted on our server.

The client can then request the translated file from our server, even
though this is a function of the server and not related to Onshape, I
have included a code snippet here that will send the file to the client.

![](images/media/image86.emf)

In our sample implementation Once the translation has completed
successfully I display a link to the translated file that calls the
“getfile” endpoint shown above.

<img src="images/media/image87.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.32917in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message Description automatically generated" />

Clicking the link will cause the file to be downloaded as shown here.

#### Translation Webhooks

As we mentioned at the beginning of this section there is more than one
way to receive notification back from Onshape that the translation has
completed. We can also define a webhook that will notify us once the
translation completes. The drawback with this methodology is that the
webhook must be created for each translation and then deleted.

A complete example of this can be found at:
<https://github.com/onshape-public/app-gltf-viewer/blob/main/services/webhook-service.js>

The following function is used in this application to define the
webhook:

![](images/media/image88.emf)

The following line would call this function once the user requests to
initiate a translation.

WebhookService.registerWebhook(req.user.accessToken,
req.session.passport.user.id, did)

Finally the endpoint registered with the webhook could be defined as
follows:

![](images/media/image89.emf)

In this case once the translation is completed, this endpoint receives a
notification. If the event is equal to

onshape.model.translation.complete

We can assume that the translation has completed and we can unregister
the webhook and retrieve the translated file.

The complete sample including it setup and deployment can be found at:
<https://github.com/onshape-public/app-gltf-viewer>

# Integrating into the Onshape Interface

So far, we have seen how we can integrate Onshape with a third party
application. We reviewed how we can use OAuth2 to authenticate access to
Onshape from our third-party application and enable Onshape to access
and the resources of our third-party application.

In this section we will review a few of the more common options for
embedding a third-party application into the Onshape interface. For the
most part this will already be setup since we have already defined one
such interface – the retrieval of part numbers from the third-party
application.

Onshape provides many options for embedding commands in various menus to
embedding interfaces in fly-out panels and elements. In this specific
use case we will look at embedding a custom web page inside the
document’s right side fly-out panel. This interface will receive
information from Onshape and push information from the panel back to
Onshape, thereby providing a complete bi-directional integration
scenario. This is very similar to what we have already done in the first
scenario by enabling a bi-directional exchange of metadata.

The following screen shot is an example of what we will be achieving
with this integration:

<img src="images/media/image90.png"
style="width:5.39312in;height:2.61532in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated with medium confidence" />

<span id="_Toc102977918" class="anchor"></span>Figure 47 - Integrating
into the document right panel

In this case we have created a custom web page that is displayed in the
right-hand fly-out panel. This interface displays metadata pulled from
the third-party system when a part in Onshape is selected.

This interface is also able to update metadata in Onshape through the
Update functionality.

## Setting up the Integration

We have already seen how to setup an application extension for the Part
Number Generator. Access the Developer portal from
<https://dev-portal.onshape.com> and click on the OAuth applications
option in the left menu. Select your application and click on the
extensions tab.

<img src="images/media/image91.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.48958in"
alt="Graphical user interface, application, Teams Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977919" class="anchor"></span>Figure 48 - Oauth
Application Extensions

Click on the Add Extension button on the top right.

As we did with the Part Number Generator we can select the Location – in
our specific case we’ll select “Element Right Panel”, however as you can
see from the dropdown list, there are many other options available for
embedding your interfaces and commands inside Onshape.

<img src="images/media/image92.png"
style="width:5.05785in;height:5.66469in"
alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977920" class="anchor"></span>Figure 49 - Defining
Application Extension

Next, we must define the context. The context defines what parameters
can be sent from Onshape to our application. There are some basic
parameters automatically sent with any context, however based upon the
context selected, additional information can be passed to our
application. In our case we will select the “Selected Part” option. This
will send the Part Id and Part Number to our application in addition to
the Document Id, the Element ID and the workspace/version ID.

Note that the full list of contexts and the parameters sent from Onshape
can be found at: <https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/extensions/>

In the Action URL field, fill in the URL of the page that you wish to
load in the right element panel. The parameters can be added as
arguments. These are variable that get replaced with real values when
the page is loaded from Onshape.

In our case our URL might look something like the following:

[https://ourserver.com/bom?documentId=${documentid}&elementId=${elementid}&partId={$partId}&partNumber={$partNumber}](https://ourserver.com/bom?documentId=$%7bdocumentid%7d&elementId=$%7belementid%7d&partId=%7b$partId%7d&partNumber=%7b$partNumber%7d)

In the case of the selected Part context for the Element Right Panel,
the possible parameters are as follows:

-   {$documentId} - The Onshape ID for the current document.

-   {$workspaceOrVersion} - This will be either ‘w’ or ‘v’ for workspace
    or version respectively depending on current opened document state
    or selection.

-   {$workspaceOrVersionId} - The Onshape ID for the current or selected
    workspace or version.

-   {$workspaceId} - The Onshape ID for the current or selected
    workspace. This is being deprecated.

-   {$versionId} - The Onshape ID for the current or selected version.
    This is being deprecated.

-   {$elementId} - The Onshape ID for the current element (Part Studio,
    Assembly, Drawing).

-   {$partNumber} - The Part number property for the selected part,
    Assembly or Drawing.

-   {$revision} - The Revision property for the selected part, Assembly
    or Drawing.

-   {$featureId} - In case of feature selected in the Feature list in a
    Part Studio.

-   {$nodeId} - In case of mate or mate feature selected in the Assembly
    list.

-   {$occurrencePath} - In case of part instances, mates, mate
    connectors and sub assemblies.

-   {$configuration} - The active configuration of the current element.

Finally select an icon for your extension. This will appear on the tab
that opens the right element panel.

We have now defined the extension and it will appear in the Onshape
interface.

## Calling a Page in the Extension

As mentioned previously we defined the URL with the parameters to load
in the application extension definition window. This will load a regular
web page within the Onshape interface. For instance, you could load your
favorite news web site in the Onshape interface, there is no requirement
to pass any parameters to the web site. However, a more practicle
implementation would require passing parameters and using those
paramters to retrieve data from our third-party application and load
that data in the resulting web page.

The following code snippet shows how we use our previous definition to
pull data from our third-party application and send it to our web page:

![](images/media/image93.emf)

In this snippet we are checking that the partNumber parameter actually
got populated – this means that a part number is defined for the
selected part. If it is defined we can then use the part number to
retrieve information about the selected part from our third-party
application.

In the event that the part number isn’t defined we can send information
to our web page that will be used to notify the user that a part number
must be defined in order to use this web page.

Note that we could also use the document ID, the element ID and the Part
ID to retrieve the correct part if they are stored with our part in our
application.

## Using our application extension

In Onshape load a document. You will already see your icon embedded in
the right element panel.

Select a part in a Part Studio and open the application:

<img src="images/media/image94.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.94236in"
alt="Graphical user interface Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977921" class="anchor"></span>Figure 50 - Application
Extension with Part Selected

In this case we selected a part that has not yet been synced with our
third-party application. Therefore no part number has been generated and
the system can’t find a corresponding object in our database.

When we select a part that has been synced and a part number has been
generated we will get a correct result as follows:

<img src="images/media/image95.png"
style="width:5.49548in;height:3.32019in"
alt="Graphical user interface Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977922" class="anchor"></span>Figure 51 - Application
extension with synced part

Since the context we selected for this application extension was
“Selected Part”, a part must be selected in order to load anything in
the extension. If no part is selected you will see a notification
similar to the following:

<img src="images/media/image96.png"
style="width:5.10442in;height:1.41408in"
alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated" />

<span id="_Toc102977923" class="anchor"></span>Figure 52 - Application
extension with no selected Part

As we have seen in this section, Onshape provides a very flexible and
easy to use interface for adding in our third-party application
functionality directly into the Onshape interface. Once we have our
application setup and correctly authenticated against Onshape, we can
easily embed third-party functionality directly into Onshape. This
enables a seamless integration with our other enterprise applications.

## Methodology Summary

We have covered a lot of ground in this guide. While we have focused on
three common business cases, there are many more and we will add them to
this documentation as they come up.

What is clear from this guide is that Onshape enables something that no
other cloud-based system provides – the ability to access Onshape’s
resources, integrate and update Onshape through an open and secure REST
API. This is unique in the market today and is a result of Onshape being
developed from the first line of code for the cloud, for multi-tenant
and with the end user in mind. It is a true modern SaaS solution. It is
for this reason that we can integrate our third-party applications
commands and interfaces directly into the Onshape interface, as
explained in the last chapter of this guide.

We have seen many tips and tricks in this guide that can help you
through the development process. Many integrators who have in the past
programed for traditional three-tier solutions, struggle with the
concepts of secure REST APIs, for this reason we spent a lot of time
explaining in detail what OAuth2 is and how to use it. Concepts such as
webhooks might be foreign to the traditional integrator, therefore we
spend a lot of time looking at the requirements for webhooks and why
they might not work, providing some best practices for their
implementation.

At the start of this guide, we reviewed the Onshape difference, this is
a key chapter for understanding why an integration to Onshape will look
different from any traditional integration you might have done before.
Programing for a SaaS solution uses different practices than you might
have used prior to implementing an Onshape integration. The key point is
to never limit the designer’s ability to innovate with the full toolset
that Onshape provides by placing integration constraints on that user.
This has been the purpose of this guide, to show you how to correctly
integrate with a true 21<sup>st</sup> century SaaS product.
