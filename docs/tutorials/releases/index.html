Please complete that one before starting on this one.</p><p>In this case, we’ll be looking at the ability for Onshape to sync its
release data with an external system and for that system to send
information back to Onshape with regards to released data.</p><p>This specific business case will look at what happens when you wish for
a PLM system to control the release of data instead of Onshape having
that control – this is in fact a common use case.</p><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage64.png style=width:3.21077in;height:2.56522in></p><p>We have mentioned before that
Onshape has the ability to release data – it is totally integrated to
Onshape since there is no division between CAD capabilities and PDM
capabilities in Onshape – they are all part of the same solution. See
Versions and Releases for more information on how Onshape manages
releases. There is importance in releasing data through Onshape. Onshape
uses visual cues to show which parts are released in an assembly for
instance and which parts might have a newer revision. Onshape can also
add/remove watermarks to drawings and update the title block depending
on release states. Also, the BOM table can pull a parts release data and
display it. All this is dependent upon a release process being completed
in Onshape.</p><p>Many organizations have implemented Product Lifecycle management systems
(PLM). One of the key benefits of a PLM system is that it manages more
than just engineering data originating from the engineering department,
it deals with all the data related to the product – from concept through
retirement. Therefore, it is a system that is used by many groups and
departments throughout the organization.</p><p>Often, in release processes or Engineering Change processes, additional
input and approvals are required from various departments downstream
from engineering. PLM systems are very good at routing the data for
approval to users from multiple departments and groups throughout the
organization. Onshape, on the other hand, is very focused on the
engineering department and the data generated there. While it certainly
has the capabilities to bring other groups into approval processes, it
is not considered a process centric enterprise-wide system with the
capabilities of a PLM system.</p><p>Many companies will have well established processes that have been
modeled in their PLM system, it is much easier for us to integrate into
those processes than reinvent the wheel in Onshape.</p><p>This section looks at how we might have the best of both worlds,
initiate release processes in Onshape and update our Onshape visual cues
as well as have the PLM system manage the actual approvals and release.</p><p>This section uses concepts such as OAuth and web hooks that we have
introduced in detail in previous sections, therefore feel free to
reference those sections for more information on these topics.</p><h3 id=step-1-initiate-release>Step 1: Initiate Release</h3><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage65.png style=width:4.88889in;height:2.02778in alt="Application Description automatically generated"></p><p>In this first step we are using Onshape’s out-of-the-box capabilities to
initiate a release candidate – just as we would if we were releasing
natively in Onshape.</p><ol><li><p>We start by initiating the release on all the data that is required.
In this step you should use a custom workflow that simply has one
approval node.</p></li><li><p>Define the mandatory and any other release properties in the release
candidate window. <img src=/images/integrationguideimage66.png style=width:4.70609in;height:3.12281in alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated"></p></li></ol><p><span id=_Toc102977911 class=anchor></span>Figure 40 - Initiating a
release candidate</p><ol start=3><li><p>Since an approver is required, we must provide a fictious
user/approver that has been defined in the system – this could be
named “Release Approver” for instance. The process will be sent to
this approver even though they are not a real person and will not be
able to approve the release. Instead, our release process will be
approved by an external source.</p></li><li><p>Finally, when everything is defined, submit the release. The window
will close. Since the release is pending approval, the parts
involved in the release will enter the state of “Pending” as shown
here:</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage67.png style=width:4.40131in;height:2.9375in alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated"></p></li></ol><p><span id=_Toc102977912 class=anchor></span>Figure 41 - Pending
Release</p><p>They will remain in this state until the release has been completed.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage68.png style=width:2.71208in;height:1.52174in></p><p>It is important to note that
unlike traditional PDM systems where the files are locked for change
until the release is completed or rejected, Onshape does not lock the
files. As mentioned previously, Onshape views the releases as a point in
time. As far as Onshape is concerned, time moves forward, parts can
change and at a specific point in time, the parts are in a state of
pending. It is important to mention that this does in fact prevent
another release from being initiated on the parts until the previous
release has been completed.</p><h3 id=step-2-initiate-release-process-in-3suprdsup-party-app>Step 2: Initiate Release Process in 3<sup>rd</sup> Party App</h3><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage69.png style=width:5.34722in;height:3.34722in alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"></p><p>Once the user initiates the release candidate and the parts transition
to the “pending” state we can register for a webhook that will notify
our third-party application that the parts have changed state.</p><ol><li><p>Once the parts enter the workflow, the onshape.workflow.transition
webhook will be triggered.</p></li><li><p>Our third-party application should be listening for this event along
with other data, we are provided with the objectId of the release
package – this is all the data associated with the parts that are to
be released. The response also contains the objectType and the
transitionName; for our use case we will only concern ourselves with
requests that have an objectType of “Release” and a transitionName
of “Submit”.</p></li><li><p>Using the ObjectId we make an API call to onshape;
/api/releasepackages/&lt;releasePackageId>?detailed=true</p></li><li><p>This API call will return to us a JSON response containing all
assemblies and parts in the release package. The following
information should be extracted from the release package:</p><ol><li><p>For each line item (assembly or part) extract the documentId,
the elementId, elementType, versionId and PartId</p></li><li><p>Iterate through the top level properties and record the
propertyId for property with the name “comment” – this will be
used to update the release comments later on.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Now that we have the relevant IDs we can update the state of our
corresponding objects in the third party system and record any
additional data such as the release comment field.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we can kick off our official release process in the
third-party application. This could be an automated process or a
manual one.</p></li></ol><h3 id=step-3-complete-release-process>Step 3: Complete Release Process</h3><p>The release process continues in the third-party application until
approvals have been received by all required actors. Meanwhile in
Onshape the parts are in the pending state. In this step we close the
loop once the release process is completed.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage70.png style=width:5.375in;height:3.34722in alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated"></p><ol><li><p>The release process managed by the third-party application is
completed and the data in that system is released.</p></li><li><p>Once this happens, we make a call to the Onshape API;
/api/releasepackages/&lt;releasePackageId> the releasePackageId is
the ID we were provided with at the start of this process – While
there are different ways of implementing this, I tend to store the
ID and any other data related to the release in a custom “release
Object” in my database so I can retrieve and update the release as
required. In addition to the passing the release package ID, in the
body of the request we should pass the id of the release comment and
a value for the comment. This will update the release in Onshape
with any relevant data.</p></li><li><p>Onshape releases the data that was included in the release candidate
and that completes the workflow process.</p></li><li><p>Onshape will return a status code that indicates success or failure</p></li><li><p>Finally we can optionally update the corresponding object to
indicate that it is in sync with the Onshape data.</p></li></ol><p>In the event that the release process is rejected at anytime, we can
send the releasePackages API request to Onshape with a REJECT workflow
Action argument. This will cause Onshape to reject the workflow and the
state of the parts at the specific release point in time, will be set to
“Rejected”.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage71.png style=width:4.69737in;height:3.12807in alt="Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated"></p><p><span id=_Toc102977914 class=anchor></span>Figure 43 - release
candidate rejected</p><p>Since our timeline is moving forward this has no actual effect on the
parts other than to cancel the pending release and enable them to be
released at another future point in time.</p><h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2><p>In this section we will take a closer look at how to implement the
release scenario in our code. The first thing we need to do is define
the correct web hook to listen for the initiation of the release – this
means that once the user clicks the submit button on the release
candidate dialog, this web hook will be triggered.</p><h3 id=set-up-webhook>Set Up Webhook</h3><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage72.emf alt></p><p>This code is very similar to what we defined previously for the metadata
update, instead here we are defining a hook for the
onshape.workflow.transition hook. As with other code examples that
require authentication, we have included error handling in order to
refresh that access token in the event that it has expired.</p><p>The onshape.workflow.transition will in fact fire whenever a revision or
release package transitions through different workflow states. In his
specific case we are only interested in catching the event when the
workflow is initially submitted. This can be filtered by the information
sent to the return URL, in this case
<a href=https://myserver.com/api/getReleaseData>https://myserver.com/api/getReleaseData</a></p><p>In this implementation we are storing he webhook ID in the database so
that we can ping it when the application is loaded to make sure that it
is still active. Other implementations delete the webhook after it is
used and then recreate it as required. There is no specific preference
for which methodology is better – that depend s upon the requirements of
your integration.</p><h3 id=receive-web-hook-notifications>Receive Web Hook Notifications</h3><p>Once the user who is initiating the release clicks the Submit button on
the Release Candidate dialog, the webhook will be triggered and a
message will be sent to the third-party application listening for that
webhook.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage66.png style=width:4.70609in;height:3.12281in alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated"></p><p>In our example the URL that the webhook data from Onshape gets sent to
is:</p><p><a href=https://myserver.com/api/getReleaseData>https://myserver.com/api/getReleaseData</a></p><p>In our application we can define a router for that end point as follows:</p><p>router.route(&rsquo;/getReleaseData&rsquo;).post(mymodule.getReleaseData);</p><p>In this case “mymodule” is where I’ve defined all the functionality for
managing data coming from Onshape. Since the webhook data contains no
authentication information (just minimal data is sent from the webhoom
for security reasons), we can’t directly authenticate our application
against Onshape, therefore we need to pass the data received from the
webhook through a method that will then add the authentication data to
our request object. The getReleaseData method simply passes the webhook
information received by the application to another authenticated
endpoint as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage73.emf alt></p><p>Here is the endpoint defined for processReleasePackage:</p><p>router.route(&rsquo;/processReleasePackage&rsquo;).post(authController.isAuthenticated,
releaseController.processReleasePackage);</p><p>As we can see here, we have now added in the authentication middleware -
authController.isAuthenticated - and can make secure calls to Onsahpe’s
API.</p><h3 id=get-release-package-data>Get Release Package Data</h3><p>The parameter that the web hook sent over to our application that we
need to make use of is the ID of the release package. We can now make a
call to Onshape to retrieve the complete release package with the ID.</p><p>We get the release package ID from the request object and make the REST
API call to get the package as follows:</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage74.emf alt></p><p>The complete release package should be returned in “response”. We can
now parse that data to retrieve the properties we need. The most
important properties will the IDs of the parts that we are going to
release – these should already be synced with our system – if not, we
can create them from the data in the release package.</p><h3 id=save-release-package-data>Save Release Package Data</h3><p>The next step is to save the properties of the release package to a
corresponding object in our database. We need at least the ID of the
release package so we can later release it automatically from the
third-party application. In this case I’m storing other properties that
came from the release candidate such as release name and description.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage75.emf alt></p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage76.png style=width:3.01875in;height:4.38889in></p><p>Most of this code deals with
retrieving values from the release package and storing them as a new
release object in the database. Additional values are associated with
the part in the PLM system. In a typical production scenario this code
would interface with the PLMs workflow capabilities and possibly kick
off a release or change process in that system. For our basic example we
are storing values from Onshape with our items and setting a state on
the part so that users can see that the part is pending release and take
actions required.</p><p>At this point in time, Onshape does not care that the part is pending a
release. The part in Onshape will remain in a pending state until it is
released by the PLM system. As noted previously, we used a user setup in
the system to specifically initiate the release, therefore no other
users will receive notifications from Onshape with regards to release
actions on this part.</p><h3 id=complete-the-release>Complete the Release</h3><p>Once the release or change workflow has completed in the PLM system and
all approvals have been received, the Part/Item will be in a released
state in the PLM system. However, we must now update Onshape with the
correct release status of the parts. It is important that Onshape data
is in sync with the corresponding data in the PLM system for reasons of
data integrity and the visual cues used within Onshape to identify a
part as released.</p><p>In a typical scenario Onshape will be automatically updated once the
workflow completes in the PLM system. In our use case we are simplifying
the process by clicking a button to release the item. This will update
the state of the part in our system and send a REST API call to Onshape
to release the data in the release package (be it one part, an assembly
with multiple parts, or drawings).</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage77.emf alt></p><p>This code snippet updates the database with the released status of a
part. Since we stored data from the release package in our database we
now retrieve the “Comment” property so that we can send an updated value
to Onshape with the release.</p><p>let attrid = rp.props.find(ob => ob.name == &ldquo;Comment&rdquo;);</p><p>The important line of code here is the REST API call to Onshape:</p><p><strong>axios.post(&lsquo;<a href="https://cad.onshape.com/api/releasepackages/'">https://cad.onshape.com/api/releasepackages/'</a> + id +
&lsquo;?wfaction=RELEASE&rsquo;</strong></p><p>The id provided here is the ID of the release package that we stored
when the web hook was called at the beginning of the process. The
“wfaction” argument indicates that the workflow action in Onshape should
be to release the data associated with this release package.</p><p>In this example we are also updating the release comments in Onshape,
for this reason we required the property ID of the Comment field – which
we also previously stored in our release object in the database.</p><p><img src=/images/integrationguideimage78.png style=width:6.5in;height:4.25903in alt="Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated"></p><p><span id=_Toc102977916 class=anchor></span>Figure 45 - Release
