&lt;h2 id="application-release-workflow-arw">Application Release Workflow (ARW)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Each application submitted to the Onshape App Store goes through a series of stage-gates:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Starting state: &lt;code>Ok to deploy to limited visibility on Production&lt;/code> (Beta testing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Ok to make Public&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goal state: &lt;code>Application is Public&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To advance to the next stage, your application must pass testing, and your App Store entry must pass review.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quality Considerations</title><link>https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/app-store/quality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://onshape-public.github.io/docs/app-store/quality/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="core-app-quality">Core App Quality&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Onshape users expect high-quality apps. App quality directly influences the long-term success of your app in terms of installs, user rating and reviews, engagement, and user retention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This page helps you assess the core aspects of quality in your app, through a compact set of quality criteria and associated tests. All Onshape apps should meet these criteria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before publishing your apps, test them against these criteria to ensure that they function well. Your testing should go well beyond what&amp;rsquo;s described here; the purpose of this page is to specify the essential quality characteristics all apps should display, so that you can cover them in your test plans.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
